class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.id = uuid.uuid4()
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

Explanation of code context:
The Python file `user.py` defines a class named `User` that represents a user with a unique ID, name, and email address. The class uses the `uuid` library to generate a unique identifier for each user instance. The class provides the following functionalities:
- The `__init__` method initializes a new `User` instance with a unique ID, name, and email address.
- The `__str__` method returns a string representation of the `User` instance, including its ID, name, and email address.
- The `update_email` method allows updating the email address of the `User` instance.
