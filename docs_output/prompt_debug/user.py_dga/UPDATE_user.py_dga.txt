Explanation of code context:
The Python file `user.py` defines a class named `User` that represents a user with a unique ID, name, and email address. The class uses the `uuid` library to generate a unique identifier for each user instance. The `User` class includes the following methods:
- `__init__(self, name, email)`: The constructor method initializes a new `User` instance with a unique ID, name, and email address.
- `__str__(self)`: This method returns a string representation of the `User` instance, including its ID, name, and email address.
- `update_email(self, new_email)`: This method allows updating the email address of the `User` instance.
