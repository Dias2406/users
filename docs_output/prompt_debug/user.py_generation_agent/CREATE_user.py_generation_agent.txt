Explanation of Every Class and Function:
- **User Class**: Represents a user with a unique ID, name, and email. It uses the `uuid` library to generate a unique identifier for each user instance.
  - **`__init__(self, name, email)`**: The constructor initializes a new User instance with a unique ID, name, and email address. The unique ID is generated using `uuid.uuid4()`.
  - **`__str__(self)`**: This method returns a string representation of the User instance, including its ID, name, and email. It is useful for printing User instances in a readable format.
  - **`update_email(self, new_email)`**: Allows updating the email address of the User instance. This method takes a new email address as input and assigns it to the instance's email attribute.

Input/Output Examples:
- **`__init__`**:
  - Input: `User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")`
  - Output: A User instance with a unique ID, name "John Doe", and email "john.doe@example.com".
- **`__str__`**:
  - Input: Assume a User instance with ID `12345`, name "John Doe", and email "john.doe@example.com".
  - Output: `"User [ID: 12345, Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com]"`
- **`update_email`**:
  - Before: User instance with email "john.doe@example.com".
  - Input: `"new.email@example.com"`
  - After: User instance with email updated to "new.email@example.com".

Called functions information:
There are no external callee functions from this file mentioned in the provided information. The `User` class is self-contained, with its functionality relying on Python's built-in `uuid` library for generating unique identifiers and standard class methods for object representation and attribute manipulation.
