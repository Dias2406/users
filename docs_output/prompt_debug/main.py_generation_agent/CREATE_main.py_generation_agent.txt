"""
The main script that creates a User instance and processes some data using the DataProcessor class.
"""
from user import User
from data_processor import DataProcessor

def main():
    user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
    print(user)

Explanation of Every Class and Function:
- **main function**: This is the entry point of the script. It performs the following actions:
  - Creates an instance of the `User` class with a name and email.
  - Prints the `User` instance. This implicitly calls the `__str__` or `__repr__` method of the `User` class, depending on its implementation.
  - Creates an instance of the `DataProcessor` class.
  - Defines a list of strings `data` and passes it to the `process_data` method of the `DataProcessor` instance to process the data.
  - Prints the processed data.

Input/Ouput Examples:
- **main function**:
  - Input: None (executed directly)
  - Output: 
    ```
    User(name=John Doe, email=john.doe@example.com)
    Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
    ```
  - This output assumes the `User` class has a `__str__` or `__repr__` method that formats the user's information, and the `DataProcessor` class's `process_data` method converts each string in the list to uppercase.

Called functions information:
- **Function user::User.__init__**:
  - This function is the constructor of the `User` class. It initializes a new `User` instance with a unique ID (using `uuid.uuid4()`), a name, and an email address. This function is called when creating a new `User` instance in the `main` function.
- **Function data_processor::DataProcessor.process_data**:
  - This function takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list where each string is converted to uppercase. It is a method of the `DataProcessor` class and is used in the `main` function to process a list of fruit names.

The `main` function serves as a simple demonstration of creating and using instances of the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes to perform specific tasks, such as initializing user information and processing data.
