"""
The main script that creates a User instance and processes some data using the DataProcessor class.
"""
from user import User
from data_processor import DataProcessor

def main():
    user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
    print(user)
    
    processor = DataProcessor()

Explanation of Every Class and Function:
- **main function**: This is the entry point of the script. It performs the following actions:
  - Creates an instance of the `User` class with a name and email.
  - Prints the `User` instance. (The output depends on the implementation of the `User` class's `__str__` or `__repr__` method, which is not shown here.)
  - Creates an instance of the `DataProcessor` class.
  - Processes a list of strings (`data`) using the `DataProcessor` instance's `process_data` method.
  - Prints the processed data.

Input/Output Examples:
- **main function**:
  - Input: None (executed when the script runs)
  - Output: This depends on the implementations of the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes. Assuming standard implementations, an example output could be:
    ```
    User: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com
    Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
    ```

Called functions information:
- **data_processor::DataProcessor.process_data**:
  - This method takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list where each string is converted to uppercase. It is used in the `main` function to process a list of fruit names.
- **user::User.__init__**:
  - This is the constructor of the `User` class. It initializes a new `User` instance with a unique ID, name, and email. The `main` function uses this constructor to create a new `User` instance with the name "John Doe" and email "john.doe@example.com".
  - **Interaction**: The `main` function directly interacts with these functions by creating instances of their respective classes and calling their methods.
  - **Context**: These functions are used in the context of initializing and demonstrating basic operations with user and data processing objects within a simple script. The `User` instance represents a user with a name and email, while the `DataProcessor` instance is used to demonstrate data manipulation.
