# main.py

## Source Code
```python
# main.py
"""
The main script that creates a User instance and processes some data using the DataProcessor class.
"""
from user import User
from data_processor import DataProcessor

def main():
    user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")

## FunctionDef main

The primary purpose of this function is to showcase the instantiation of a `User` object and the utilization of the `DataProcessor` class for data manipulation.

**Parameters**:

- This function does not accept any parameters.

**Returns**:

- This function does not return any values.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: This method initializes a new `User` instance with a specified name and email address, assigning a unique ID to the user.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: This method takes a list of data items as input and returns a new list with each item converted to uppercase, demonstrating basic data processing.

**Code Description**: At the script's entry point, the `main` function is responsible for demonstrating the creation and utilization of class instances in Python. Initially, it creates a `User` instance with a given name and email. The user's information is then printed to the console. Subsequently, a `DataProcessor` instance is created, and a predefined list of fruit names is processed. The transformation involves converting each fruit name to uppercase, and the processed list is printed to showcase the outcome.

**Note**: For this script to function correctly, it is essential that the `user` and `data_processor` modules are located within the same directory as this script or are accessible in the Python path. This ensures that the necessary classes can be imported without issues.

**Input Example**: 

```
As the main entry point, this function does not directly receive input from an external source. It internally utilizes a predefined list of strings ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] as input for the DataProcessor.process_data method.
```

**Output Example**: 

```
<User object at 0x7fcd3b2c1d30>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```

The output showcases two key operations: the display of the `User` object (note: the actual memory address will vary) and the presentation of the processed data list, where each fruit name has been converted to uppercase, illustrating the data processing capability of the `DataProcessor` class.
