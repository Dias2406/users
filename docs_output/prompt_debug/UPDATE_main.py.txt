# main.py Documentation Review

## Overview
This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the `main.py` script, which demonstrates the creation of a `User` instance and the processing of a list of data items using the `DataProcessor` class. The script showcases basic class instantiation and method invocation in Python.

## Function: main

The `main` function serves as the entry point of the script, illustrating how to work with custom classes in Python by performing specific actions.

### Actions Performed:
1. **User Instance Creation**: Initializes a `User` instance with predefined name and email attributes.
2. **Data Processing**: Utilizes the `DataProcessor` class to process a predefined list of strings, converting each string to uppercase.

### Parameters:
- The function does not accept any parameters.

### Returns:
- The function does not return any value.

### Called Functions:
- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: This method is responsible for creating a new `User` instance with the specified name and email.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: This method processes a list of data items by converting each item to uppercase.

### Code Description:
- A `User` instance named "John Doe" with the email "john.doe@example.com" is created and its representation is printed to the console.
- A `DataProcessor` instance is created without any initial parameters.
- A list of strings `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` is defined and passed to the `process_data` method of the `DataProcessor` instance. The method processes the data by converting each string in the list to uppercase.
- The processed data list is printed to the console, showcasing the result of the data processing.

### Note:
For the script to run successfully, it is crucial to have the `user.py` and `data_processor.py` modules available in the same directory as `main.py`. This script is a basic demonstration of using class instances and method calls in Python.

### Input Example:
No direct input is provided to the `main` function as it does not accept any parameters. The data processed within the function is a predefined list of strings: `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.

### Output Example:
```
<User instance representation>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
The `<User instance representation>` output depends on the implementation of the `__str__` or `__repr__` method in the `User` class. The processed data output illustrates the conversion of each item in the input list to uppercase.
