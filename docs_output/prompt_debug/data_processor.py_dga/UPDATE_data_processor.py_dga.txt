The content of the file (source code) is as follows:
```python
# data_processor.py
from .utils import validate_email

"""
Contains the DataProcessor class which has methods for processing data and checking the validity of email addresses using the function from utils.py.
"""
class DataProcessor:
    def process_data(self, data):
        return [item.upper() for item in data]
    
    def check_emails(self, emails):
        return [validate_email(email) for email in emails]
```

Explanation of code context:
The Python file `data_processor.py` defines a class named `DataProcessor` that contains methods for processing data and validating email addresses. It has two methods:
- `process_data(self, data)`: Takes a list of data items as input and returns a new list with each item converted to uppercase.
- `check_emails(self, emails)`: Takes a list of email addresses as input and checks the validity of each email address using the `validate_email` function imported from `utils.py`. It returns a list of boolean values indicating whether each email address is valid.

Callee function information:
```python
Function/Class utils::validate_email:

def validate_email(email):
    pattern = '^[a-z0-9]+[\\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\\w+[.]\\w+$'
    if re.match(pattern, email):
        return True
    return False
```
The callee function `validate_email` in `utils.py` is used by the `DataProcessor` class to validate email addresses. It defines a regular expression pattern to match valid email addresses and returns `True` if the email matches the pattern, otherwise `False`.
