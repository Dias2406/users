The content of the file (source code) is as follows:
```python
# data_processor.py
from .utils import validate_email

"""
Contains the DataProcessor class which has methods for processing data and checking the validity of email addresses using the function from utils.py.
"""
class DataProcessor:
    def process_data(self, data):
        return [item.upper() for item in data]
    
    def check_emails(self, emails):
        return [validate_email(email) for email in emails]
```

Explanation of code context:
This Python file defines a class named `DataProcessor` that contains methods for processing data and validating email addresses. The class has two methods:
- `process_data(self, data)`: This method takes a list of data items as input and returns a new list with each item converted to uppercase. This method is useful for standardizing the format of data items.
- `check_emails(self, emails)`: This method takes a list of email addresses as input and checks the validity of each email address using the `validate_email` function imported from the `utils` module. It returns a list of boolean values indicating whether each email address is valid.

Callee function information:
The callee function in this context is `validate_email` from the `utils` module. Here is a brief description of its functionality and usage:
```python
def validate_email(email):
    pattern = '^[a-z0-9]+[\\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\\w+[.]\\w+$'
    if re.match(pattern, email):
        return True
    return False
```
The `validate_email` function checks if the given email address matches a specific pattern that represents a valid email format. It uses a regular expression to match the email address against the pattern. If the email address matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This function is used by the `DataProcessor` class to validate email addresses in the `check_emails` method.
