# user.py

## Overview:
The `user.py` file defines a single class, `User`, which represents a user with a unique ID, name, and email address. The purpose of this class is to encapsulate user-related data and provide methods for interacting with this data, such as updating the user's email address. The class utilizes the `uuid` library to generate a unique identifier for each user instance, ensuring that each user has a distinct ID. This file is essential for applications that require user management and identification.

## ClassDef User

The `User` class is designed to represent a user within an application. It includes attributes for the user's ID, name, and email address. The class provides a constructor for initializing new instances with a name and email, a method for updating the user's email address, and a method for obtaining a string representation of the user instance. The unique ID is generated using the `uuid.uuid4()` method, ensuring that each user instance has a unique identifier.

### `__init__(self, name, email)`

This method is the constructor for the `User` class. It initializes a new User instance with a unique ID, name, and email address.

**Parameters**:
- `name`: A string representing the user's name.
- `email`: A string representing the user's email address.

**Returns**:
- None.

**Note**: The unique ID is generated using the `uuid.uuid4()` method from the `uuid` library.

#### Examples:
**Input Example**: 
```
user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
```
**Output Example**:
```
A User instance with a unique ID, name "John Doe", and email "john.doe@example.com".
```

### `__str__(self)`

Provides a string representation of the User instance, including its ID, name, and email.

**Parameters**:
- None.

**Returns**:
- A string that includes the user's ID, name, and email address.

**Note**: This method is useful for printing User instances in a readable format.

#### Examples:
**Input Example**: 
```
Assume a User instance with ID `12345`, name "John Doe", and email "john.doe@example.com".
```
**Output Example**:
```
"User [ID: 12345, Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com]"
```

### `update_email(self, new_email)`

Allows updating the email address of the User instance.

**Parameters**:
- `new_email`: A string representing the new email address to be assigned to the user.

**Returns**:
- None.

**Note**: This method updates the `email` attribute of the User instance with the new email address provided.

#### Examples:
**Input Example**: 
```
Before: User instance with email "john.doe@example.com".
Input: "new.email@example.com"
```
**Output Example**:
```
After: User instance with email updated to "new.email@example.com".
```

## Called_functions:
The `User` class is self-contained and primarily relies on the `uuid` library for generating unique identifiers. It does not call external functions beyond those provided by Python's standard libraries and the `uuid` module. The class methods focus on initializing user instances, updating user attributes, and representing user instances as strings.
