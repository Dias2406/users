"""
Contains the DataProcessor class which has methods for processing data and checking the validity of email addresses using the function from utils.py.

class DataProcessor:
    def process_data(self, data):

        return [validate_email(email) for email in emails]
```

Explanation of Every Class and Function:
- **Class DataProcessor**: This class is designed for processing data and validating email addresses. It contains two methods:
  - **process_data(self, data)**: This method takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list where each string is converted to uppercase. Its purpose is to perform a simple transformation on the input data.
  - **check_emails(self, emails)**: This method takes a list of email addresses as input and returns a list of boolean values indicating whether each email address is valid or not. It utilizes the `validate_email` function from the `utils` module to perform the validation.

Input/Ouput Examples:
- **process_data**:
  - Input: `['hello', 'world']`
  - Output: `['HELLO', 'WORLD']`
  - This method converts all the input strings to uppercase.
- **check_emails**:
  - Input: `['test@example.com', 'invalid_email']`
  - Output: `[True, False]`
  - This method checks each email against a validation pattern and returns `True` if the email is valid, otherwise `False`.

Called functions information:
- **Function utils::validate_email**:
  - This function takes a single email address as input and returns `True` if the email matches a specific pattern indicating it is a valid email address, otherwise it returns `False`. It uses regular expressions to match the email against the pattern `'^[a-z0-9]+[\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\w+[.]\w+$'`. This function is called by the `check_emails` method of the `DataProcessor` class to validate each email address in the input list. The interaction between `check_emails` and `validate_email` is crucial for the email validation functionality provided by the `DataProcessor` class.
