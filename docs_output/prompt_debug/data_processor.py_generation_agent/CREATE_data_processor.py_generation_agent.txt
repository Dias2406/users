class DataProcessor:
    def process_data(self, data):

        return [validate_email(email) for email in emails]
```

Explanation of Every Class and Function:
- **DataProcessor Class**: This class is designed for processing data and validating email addresses. It contains two methods:
  - **process_data(self, data)**: This method takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list where each string is converted to uppercase. It's useful for standardizing text data.
  - **check_emails(self, emails)**: This method takes a list of email addresses as input and checks each email's validity using the `validate_email` function imported from `utils.py`. It returns a list of boolean values indicating whether each email is valid.

Input/Output Examples:
- **process_data**:
  - Input: `['hello', 'world']`
  - Output: `['HELLO', 'WORLD']`
- **check_emails**:
  - Input: `['user@example.com', 'invalid-email']`
  - Output: `[True, False]` (Assuming `validate_email` correctly identifies the first email as valid and the second as invalid.)

Called functions information:
- **utils::validate_email(email)**:
  - This function is defined in `utils.py` and is responsible for validating email addresses. It uses a regular expression pattern to match email addresses and returns `True` if the email matches the pattern, otherwise `False`.
  - **Interaction**: The `check_emails` method in the `DataProcessor` class calls this function for each email in the input list to determine its validity.
  - **Context**: It is used within the context of email validation in the `DataProcessor` class to ensure that only valid email addresses are processed or stored. This function is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing invalid data entry.
