Context: 
# main.py

## Overview:
The `main.py` file serves as the entry point for a simple script designed to demonstrate the instantiation and utilization of classes from separate modules. It primarily involves creating an instance of a `User` class, displaying its information, and processing a list of data through the `DataProcessor` class. The script showcases basic object-oriented programming concepts in Python, including class instantiation, method invocation, and the use of the `if __name__ == "__main__":` idiom to execute code blocks conditionally.

## FunctionDef main

The `main` function acts as the central execution point of the script. It orchestrates the creation of a `User` object with predefined attributes, prints this object (implicitly invoking the `User` class's string representation method), processes a predefined list of strings through the `DataProcessor` class, and finally prints the processed data.

**Parameters**:

- None

**Returns**:

- None

## Called_functions:

- **user::User.__init__**: Initializes a new `User` instance with a name and email. This is demonstrated when the `User` object is created with "John Doe" and "john.doe@example.com" as arguments.
- **data_processor::DataProcessor.process_data**: Accepts a list of strings and returns a new list with each string modified, presumably to uppercase based on the context provided. This method is called with a list of fruit names and returns their uppercase versions.

**Note**: The actual implementations of `User.__init__` and `DataProcessor.process_data` are not provided in the `main.py` file. Their behaviors are inferred based on the usage within `main.py` and the provided output example. It's important to review these methods in their respective modules for a complete understanding of their functionalities.

## Examples:

**Input Examples**: 

```
None (The main function is executed directly without input parameters)
```

**Output Example**:

```
User(name=John Doe, email=john.doe@example.com)
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```

This output demonstrates the creation of a `User` object with specific attributes and the processing of a list of strings through the `DataProcessor` class. The exact output may vary based on the implementations of the `User` class's string representation method and the `DataProcessor.process_data` method.

**Note**: The provided code snippet and explanation assume certain behaviors for the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes based on their usage in `main.py`. For a comprehensive understanding, it's recommended to review the source code of these classes. Additionally, the script is a straightforward example of using classes and methods in Python, making it suitable for educational purposes or as a template for more complex applications.
