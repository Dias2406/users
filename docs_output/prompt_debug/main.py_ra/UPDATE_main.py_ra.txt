## FunctionDef main

The function of the function is to create a User instance and process data using the DataProcessor class.

**Parameters**:

None.

**Returns**:

None.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: Initializes a new User instance with a unique ID, name, and email.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: Processes a list of data items by converting each item to uppercase.
- `DataProcessor.check_emails(emails: list) -> list`: Checks the validity of each email address in the given list.

**Code Description**: The `main` function serves as the entry point of the script. It performs the following operations:
- Creates a `User` instance with a specified name and email.
- Instantiates a `DataProcessor` object.
- Processes a list of data items (`["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`) by converting them to uppercase using the `process_data` method of `DataProcessor`.
- Checks the validity of a list of email addresses using the `check_emails` method of `DataProcessor`.
- Prints the results of the processed data and the validity check of the email addresses.

**Note**: This script demonstrates the basic usage of the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes. It is essential to ensure that the `user` and `data_processor` modules are correctly imported and available in the same directory or Python path.

**Input Example**: 

```
No direct input is provided to the main function as it serves as the entry point of the script. However, it internally uses a list of data items and a list of email addresses for processing.
```

**Output Example**: 

```
Checked Emails: [True, False]
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```

This output example shows the result of processing a list of data items and checking the validity of email addresses. The processed data is a list of the original data items converted to uppercase. The checked emails result indicates the validity of each email address in the provided list, with `True` representing a valid email and `False` indicating an invalid email.
