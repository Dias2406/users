## FunctionDef main

The function of the function is to create a User instance and process a list of data using the DataProcessor class.

**Parameters**:

None.

**Returns**:

None.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: Initializes a new User instance with a unique ID, name, and email address.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: Processes a list of data items by converting each item to uppercase.

**Code Description**: This function serves as the entry point of the script. It performs the following actions:
1. Creates a `User` instance with a specified name and email.
2. Prints the `User` instance to the console.
3. Creates a `DataProcessor` instance.
4. Defines a list of data items and uses the `DataProcessor` instance to process this data by converting each item to uppercase.
5. Prints the processed data to the console.

**Note**: This script requires the `user.py` and `data_processor.py` files to be present in the same directory for the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes, respectively.

**Input Example**: 

```
No direct input is provided to this function. However, it internally uses a list of strings as input to the DataProcessor.process_data function.
```

**Output Example**: 

```
User instance printed to the console, followed by the processed data list in uppercase.
Example:
<User object at 0x7fcd3e4>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
