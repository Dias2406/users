"""
The main script that creates a User instance and processes some data using the DataProcessor class.
"""
from user import User
from data_processor import DataProcessor

def main():
    user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
    print(user)
    
    processor = DataProcessor()
    data = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

## FunctionDef main

The function of the function is to demonstrate the creation of a `User` instance and the processing of data using the `DataProcessor` class.

**Code Description**: This function serves as the entry point of the script. It first creates an instance of the `User` class with a specified name and email, then prints the user information. Following this, it creates an instance of the `DataProcessor` class and uses it to process a predefined list of data items. The processed data, which consists of the original data items converted to uppercase, is then printed to the console. This function showcases the basic usage of the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes by integrating them into a simple workflow.

**Note**: This script is intended to be run as the main program. It demonstrates how to instantiate and use the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes. Ensure that the `user` and `data_processor` modules are correctly imported and available in the same environment as this script.

**Input Example**: 

```
No direct input is provided to the `main` function. However, it internally uses a list of strings: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].
```

**Output Example**: 

```
<User object representation>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
The exact output will depend on the implementation of the `__str__` or `__repr__` method in the `User` class. The processed data shows the original list of strings converted to uppercase.

## Note
This script is a simple demonstration and should be adapted or extended based on specific requirements. For instance, the list of data items to be processed can be modified, or additional functionalities can be added to the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes to make the script more versatile.
