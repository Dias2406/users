## FunctionDef main

The function of the function is to demonstrate the creation of a User instance and the processing of data using the DataProcessor class.

**Parameters**:

None.

**Returns**:

None.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: Initializes a new User instance with a name and email.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: Processes a list of data items and returns a new list with all items converted to uppercase.

**Code Description**: This function serves as the entry point of the script. It first creates a `User` instance with a specified name and email, then prints the user information. Following that, it creates a `DataProcessor` instance and uses it to process a predefined list of data items. The processed data, which consists of the original data items converted to uppercase, is then printed. This demonstrates the basic usage of the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes.

**Note**: This script is intended to be run as the main program. It demonstrates how to create instances of the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes and use them to process data.

**Input Example**: 

```
No direct input is provided to the main function. However, the data processed by the DataProcessor instance is ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].
```

**Output Example**: 

```
<User instance information>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
The output includes the string representation of the `User` instance (which depends on the implementation of the `User` class's `__str__` or `__repr__` method) followed by the processed data list, which contains the original data items converted to uppercase.
