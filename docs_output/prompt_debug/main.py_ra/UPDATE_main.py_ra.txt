## FunctionDef main

The function of the function is to create a User instance and process a list of data using the DataProcessor class.

**Parameters**:

None.

**Returns**:

None.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: Initializes a new User instance with a name and email.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: Processes a list of data items, converting each item to uppercase.

**Code Description**: This function serves as the entry point of the script. It performs the following actions:
- Creates a `User` instance with a specified name and email address and prints the instance to the console.
- Creates a `DataProcessor` instance.
- Defines a list of data items and uses the `DataProcessor` instance to process this data, converting each item to uppercase.
- Prints the processed data to the console.

**Note**: This script demonstrates the basic usage of creating instances from imported classes and processing data. It is essential to have the `user` and `data_processor` modules available in the same workspace for this script to run successfully.

**Input Example**: 

```
No direct input is provided to this function as it is the main entry point of the script. However, it internally uses a list of strings ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] as data to be processed.
```

**Output Example**: 

```
<User instance representation>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
The output includes the string representation of the `User` instance (which depends on the implementation of the `__str__` or `__repr__` method in the `User` class) followed by the processed data list, where each item is converted to uppercase.
