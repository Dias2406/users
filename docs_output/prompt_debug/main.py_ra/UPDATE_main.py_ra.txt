## FunctionDef main

The function of the function is to create a User instance and process a list of data using the DataProcessor class.

**Parameters**:

None.

**Returns**:

None.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: Initializes a new User instance with a name and email.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: Processes a list of data items by converting each item to uppercase.

**Code Description**: This function serves as the entry point of the script. It performs the following actions:
1. Creates a `User` instance with a specified name and email.
2. Prints the `User` instance to the console, which likely invokes the `__str__` or `__repr__` method of the `User` class to display user information.
3. Creates a `DataProcessor` instance without any parameters.
4. Defines a list of data items (`["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`) and processes this data using the `process_data` method of the `DataProcessor` instance, which converts each item to uppercase.
5. Prints the processed data to the console.

**Note**: The `User` and `DataProcessor` classes must be defined in separate files (`user.py` and `data_processor.py`, respectively) and correctly implemented for this script to work as intended.

**Input Example**: 

No direct input is provided to this function as it serves as the entry point of the script. However, it internally uses a list of strings `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` as input to the `DataProcessor.process_data` method.

**Output Example**: 

The output to the console might look like this:
```
User: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
This output includes the string representation of the `User` instance followed by the processed data list, where each item has been converted to uppercase.
