## FunctionDef main

The function of the function is to create a User instance and process a list of data using the DataProcessor class.

**Parameters**:

None.

**Returns**:

None.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: Initializes a new User instance with a name and email.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: Processes a list of data items, converting each item to uppercase.

**Code Description**: This function serves as the entry point of the script. It performs the following actions:
- Creates a `User` instance named "John Doe" with the email "john.doe@example.com" and prints the instance.
- Creates a `DataProcessor` instance.
- Defines a list of strings `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` and passes it to the `DataProcessor` instance for processing. The processing involves converting each string in the list to uppercase.
- Prints the processed data list to the console.

**Note**: This script demonstrates the basic usage of class instances and method calls in Python. It is essential to have the `user.py` and `data_processor.py` modules available in the same directory as `main.py` for this script to run successfully.

**Input Example**: 

```
No direct input is provided to the `main` function as it does not accept any parameters. However, the data processed within the function is a list of strings: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].
```

**Output Example**: 

```
<User instance representation>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
The exact representation of the `<User instance representation>` depends on the implementation of the `__str__` or `__repr__` method in the `User` class. The processed data output shows each item in the input list converted to uppercase.
