## FunctionDef main

The function of the function is to demonstrate the creation of a `User` instance and the processing of data using the `DataProcessor` class.

**Parameters**:

- This function does not have parameters.

**Returns**:

- This function does not return a value.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: Initializes a new `User` instance with a unique ID, name, and email address.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: Processes a list of data items by converting each item to uppercase.

**Code Description**: The `main` function serves as the entry point of the script. It first creates a `User` instance with a specified name and email address, then prints the user information. Following this, it creates a `DataProcessor` instance and uses it to process a predefined list of data items (fruits). The processed data, which consists of the data items converted to uppercase, is printed to demonstrate the result.

**Note**: This script is a simple demonstration of class instantiation and method calling in Python. It is important to have the `user` and `data_processor` modules available in the same directory as this script or in the Python path.

**Input Example**: 

```
No direct input is provided to this function as it is the main entry point of the script. However, it internally uses a list of strings ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] as input to the DataProcessor.process_data function.
```

**Output Example**: 

```
<User object at 0x7fcd3b2c1d30>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```

This output demonstrates the printing of the `User` object (the actual memory address will vary) and the result of processing the data list, which is each item converted to uppercase.
