## FunctionDef main

The function of the function is to create a User instance and process a list of data using the DataProcessor class.

**Parameters**:

None.

**Returns**:

None.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: Initializes a new User instance with a name and email.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: Processes a list of data items, converting each item to uppercase.

**Code Description**: This function serves as the entry point of the script. It performs the following actions:
- Creates a `User` instance with a specified name and email address.
- Prints the `User` instance to the console.
- Creates a `DataProcessor` instance.
- Defines a list of data items and uses the `DataProcessor` instance to process this data by converting each item to uppercase.
- Prints the processed data to the console.

**Note**: Ensure that the `user` and `data_processor` modules are correctly imported and available in the project directory for this script to run successfully.

**Input Example**: 

```
No direct input is provided to the main function. However, it internally uses a list of strings: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].
```

**Output Example**: 

```
<User instance representation>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
The output includes the string representation of the `User` instance (implementation dependent) followed by the processed data list, where each item is converted to uppercase.
