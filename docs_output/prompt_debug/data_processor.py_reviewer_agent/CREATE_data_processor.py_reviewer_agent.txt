# data_processor.py

## Overview:
The `data_processor.py` file contains the `DataProcessor` class, which is designed for processing data and validating email addresses. The class includes methods for transforming data into uppercase and for checking the validity of email addresses using a function imported from `utils.py`. This file is essential for applications that require data manipulation and email validation functionalities, providing a straightforward interface for these operations.

## ClassDef DataProcessor

The `DataProcessor` class is central to the `data_processor.py` file, offering functionalities for data processing and email validation. It is equipped with two methods: `process_data` for data transformation and `check_emails` for validating email addresses. The class leverages the `validate_email` function from the `utils` module for email validation, showcasing an example of function import and usage within a class context.

**Attributes (for classes)**:

- This class does not explicitly define any attributes. It operates on the parameters passed to its methods.

### FunctionDef process_data

The `process_data` method is responsible for transforming a list of strings by converting each string into uppercase. This method exemplifies a simple yet common data processing operation, making it suitable for scenarios where text normalization is required.

**Parameters**:

- `data` (`list`): A list of strings to be transformed.

**Returns**:

- `list`: A new list containing the uppercase versions of the input strings.

### FunctionDef check_emails

The `check_emails` method validates a list of email addresses by checking each against a specific pattern to determine its validity. It utilizes the `validate_email` function from the `utils` module, demonstrating how external functions can be integrated into class methods for extended functionalities.

**Parameters**:

- `emails` (`list`): A list of email addresses to be validated.

**Returns**:

- `list`: A list of boolean values, each corresponding to the validity of the email addresses in the input list.

## Called_functions:
### validate_email (from utils module)
This function is crucial for the email validation process in the `check_emails` method. It takes a single email address as input and returns `True` if the email is valid, otherwise `False`. The validation is based on a regular expression pattern, making it a flexible and reliable way to ensure email addresses meet a specific format.

## Examples:
### process_data
**Input Example**: `['hello', 'world']`

```
The method is called with a list of lowercase strings.
```

**Output Example**: `['HELLO', 'WORLD']`

```
The output is a list of the input strings converted to uppercase, demonstrating the method's data transformation capability.
```

### check_emails
**Input Example**: `['test@example.com', 'invalid_email']`

```
The method is called with a list containing a valid and an invalid email address.
```

**Output Example**: `[True, False]`

```
The output is a list of boolean values indicating the validity of each email address, showcasing the method's ability to validate emails.
```

**Note**: The `data_processor.py` file and its `DataProcessor` class provide essential functionalities for data processing and email validation. The clear separation of concerns and the use of an external validation function make it a valuable example of Python class design and function usage.
