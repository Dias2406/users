# data_processor.py

## Overview:
The `data_processor.py` file contains the `DataProcessor` class, which is designed for processing data and validating email addresses. It leverages a utility function from another module (`utils.py`) to check the validity of email addresses. The class provides methods for converting strings in a list to uppercase and for validating a list of email addresses. This file is essential for tasks that involve data standardization and validation, particularly in applications where email communication or data processing is a critical component.

## ClassDef DataProcessor

The `DataProcessor` class is central to the `data_processor.py` file. It is designed with two primary functionalities in mind: processing textual data by converting it to uppercase and validating email addresses using an external utility function. This class is useful in scenarios where data needs to be standardized or validated before further processing or storage.

### Method process_data
The `process_data` method is responsible for converting each string in a given list to uppercase. This method is particularly useful for standardizing text data, ensuring consistency across datasets or inputs.

**Parameters**:
- `data` (list of str): A list of strings that will be processed.

**Returns**:
- list of str: A new list containing the uppercase versions of the input strings.

**Note**: This method does not modify the original list but returns a new list with the processed data.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```
['hello', 'world']
```
This input represents a list of lowercase strings.

**Output Example**:
```
['HELLO', 'WORLD']
```
The output is a list of the input strings converted to uppercase, demonstrating the method's functionality in standardizing text data.

### Method check_emails
The `check_emails` method checks the validity of each email address in a given list by utilizing the `validate_email` function from the `utils.py` module. It returns a list of boolean values indicating the validity of each email address.

**Parameters**:
- `emails` (list of str): A list of email addresses to be validated.

**Returns**:
- list of bool: A list indicating the validity of each email address in the input list.

**Note**: This method relies on the `validate_email` function from an external module (`utils.py`), which should be correctly implemented for accurate validation.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```
['user@example.com', 'invalid-email']
```
This input represents a list of email addresses to be validated.

**Output Example**:
```
[True, False]
```
The output is a list of boolean values indicating the validity of each email address, with `True` representing a valid email and `False` representing an invalid one.

## Called_functions:
- **utils::validate_email(email)**: This function is defined in `utils.py` and is responsible for validating email addresses. It uses a regular expression pattern to match email addresses and returns `True` if the email matches the pattern, otherwise `False`. The `check_emails` method in the `DataProcessor` class calls this function for each email in the input list to determine its validity. This function is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing invalid data entry.
