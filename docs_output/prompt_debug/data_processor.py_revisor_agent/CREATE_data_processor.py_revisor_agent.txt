# data_processor.py

## Overview:
The `data_processor.py` file contains the `DataProcessor` class, which is designed for processing data and validating email addresses. It leverages a utility function from another module (`utils.py`) to check the validity of email addresses. The class provides methods for converting strings in a list to uppercase and for validating a list of email addresses. This file is essential for tasks that involve data standardization and validation, particularly in applications where email communication or data processing is a critical component.

## ClassDef DataProcessor

The `DataProcessor` class is central to the `data_processor.py` file. It is designed with two primary functionalities in mind: processing textual data by converting it to uppercase and validating email addresses using an external utility function. This class is useful in scenarios where data needs to be standardized or validated before further processing or storage.

### Method process_data
The `process_data` method is responsible for converting each string in a given list to uppercase. This method is particularly useful for standardizing text data, ensuring consistency across datasets or inputs.

**Parameters**:
- `data` (list of str): A list of strings that will be processed.

**Returns**:
- list of str: A new list containing the uppercase versions of the input strings.

**Note**: This method does not modify the original list but returns a new list with the processed data.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```
['hello', 'world']
```
This input represents a list of lowercase strings.

**Output Example**:
```
['HELLO', 'WORLD']
```
The output is a list of the input strings converted to uppercase, demonstrating the method's functionality in standardizing text data.

### Method check_emails
The `check_emails` method checks the validity of each email address in a given list by utilizing the `validate_email` function from the `utils.py` module. It returns a list of boolean values indicating the validity of each email address.

**Parameters**:
- `emails` (list of str): A list of email addresses to be validated.

**Returns**:
- list of bool: A list indicating the validity of each email address in the input list.

**Note**: This method relies on the `validate_email` function from an external module (`utils.py`), which should be correctly implemented for accurate validation.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```
['user@example.com', 'invalid-email']
```
This input represents a list of email addresses to be validated.

**Output Example**:
```
[True, False]
```
The output is a list of boolean values indicating the validity of each email address, with `True` representing a valid email and `False` representing an invalid one.

## Called_functions:
- **utils::validate_email(email)**: This function is defined in `utils.py` and is responsible for validating email addresses. It uses a regular expression pattern to match email addresses and returns `True` if the email matches the pattern, otherwise `False`. The `check_emails` method in the `DataProcessor` class calls this function for each email in the input list to determine its validity. This function is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing invalid data entry.

Reviewer agent suggestions:
1. For the `process_data` method, consider adding a brief explanation about why it might be important to standardize text data to uppercase. This could help users understand the potential applications of this method beyond the provided example.

2. For the `check_emails` method, it would be beneficial to include information about what constitutes a valid email address according to the `validate_email` function in `utils.py`. This could involve a brief mention of the criteria used (e.g., presence of an "@" symbol and a domain name). This addition would provide users with a clearer understanding of how email validation is performed and what to expect from the method's output.

3. In the **Examples** section for both methods, it would be helpful to include more diverse examples to cover edge cases or less common scenarios. For instance, for the `process_data` method, an example with mixed case and special characters could be added. For the `check_emails` method, examples including email addresses with unusual but valid formats, and common invalid formats, would enrich the documentation.

4. The documentation could benefit from a brief description of the `validate_email` function's return behavior when encountering edge cases, such as an empty string or a string that does not contain an email address at all. This would help users better understand how the `check_emails` method behaves in these scenarios.

5. It might be useful to add a section on potential exceptions or errors that users might encounter while using the `DataProcessor` class methods. For example, detailing what happens if the `data` parameter for the `process_data` method is not a list of strings, or if the `emails` parameter for the `check_emails` method contains non-string elements. This would prepare users to handle such situations more effectively.

6. Consider adding a note about the performance implications of using these methods with very large datasets. For instance, processing a very large list of strings or validating a large list of email addresses might have performance considerations that users should be aware of.

7. Lastly, it would be beneficial to include a section or note about how users can extend or customize the `DataProcessor` class for their specific needs. For example, modifying the `process_data` method to handle different text transformations or extending the `check_emails` method to use different validation criteria. This would encourage users to adapt the class more closely to their application requirements.
