You are an AI documentation assistant. Your task is to update the existing documentation based on the provided changes in the code. 

Now you need to update the document for "user.py".

**Old Documentation**:
The documentation provided for the `User` class in `user.py` is comprehensive and well-structured, offering clear insights into the class's purpose, attributes, and methods. However, there are a few areas where the documentation can be enhanced for clarity and completeness. Below are the improvements made to the original documentation:

---

# user.py

## Source Code
```python
# user.py
import uuid

"""
Contains the User class which uses the uuid library to generate unique user IDs.
"""
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.id = uuid.uuid4()
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"User [ID: {self.id}, Name: {self.name}, Email: {self.email}]"
    
    def update_email(self, new_email):
        self.email = new_email
```

## Class Definition: User

The `User` class is designed to encapsulate user information within an application, assigning a unique ID to each user instance for identification purposes. It includes basic user details such as name and email address.

**Attributes**:

- `id` (`UUID`): Automatically generated unique identifier for the user, utilizing the `uuid` library.
- `name` (`str`): The user's name.
- `email` (`str`): The user's email address.

**Methods**:

- `__init__(self, name: str, email: str) -> None`:
    Initializes a new instance of the `User` class.
    - Parameters:
        - `name` (`str`): The name of the user.
        - `email` (`str`): The email address of the user.
    - Returns: None. This method does not return a value but initializes a `User` object.

- `__str__(self) -> str`:
    Provides a string representation of the `User` instance.
    - Returns:
        - `str`: A formatted string that includes the user's ID, name, and email.

- `update_email(self, new_email: str) -> None`:
    Updates the email address of the user.
    - Parameters:
        - `new_email` (`str`): The new email address to be assigned to the user.
    - Returns: None. This method updates the `email` attribute of the `User` instance.

**Code Description**: This class leverages the `uuid` library to ensure each user instance is assigned a unique identifier (`id`). It provides functionality to update a user's email address and to represent the user instance as a string, which includes the user's unique ID, name, and email address.

**Note**: Before using the `update_email` method, it is recommended to validate the new email address to ensure it adheres to standard email format conventions.

**Input Example**: 

```python
new_user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to create a new `User` instance with the name "John Doe" and the email "john.doe@example.com".

**Output Example**:

```python
print(new_user)
```
This will produce an output similar to: `User [ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000, Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com]`. Note that the ID will be a unique UUID value generated for each user instance.

These enhancements aim to provide clearer explanations and ensure that the documentation is as informative and user-friendly as possible.
