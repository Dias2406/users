You are an AI documentation assistant. Your task is to update the existing documentation based on the provided changes in the code. 

Now you need to update the document for "user.py".

**Old Documentation**:
The documentation provided for the `User` class in `user.py` is comprehensive and well-structured, offering clear insights into the class's purpose, attributes, and methods. However, there are a few areas where the documentation can be slightly improved for clarity and completeness. Below are the enhancements made to the original documentation:

---

# user.py

## Source Code
```python
# user.py
import uuid

"""
Contains the User class which uses the uuid library to generate unique user IDs.
"""
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.id = uuid.uuid4()
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"User [ID: {self.id}, Name: {self.name}, Email: {self.email}]"
    
    def update_email(self, new_email):
        self.email = new_email
```

## Class Definition: User

The `User` class is designed to represent a user entity with a unique ID, name, and email address. It leverages the `uuid` library to ensure each user is assigned a distinct identifier.

**Attributes**:

- `id` (`UUID`): A unique identifier for the user, automatically generated upon instance creation.
- `name` (`str`): The user's name.
- `email` (`str`): The user's email address.

**Methods**:

- `__init__(self, name: str, email: str) -> None`:
    Initializes a new instance of the `User` class.
    - Parameters:
        - `name` (`str`): The name of the user.
        - `email` (`str`): The email address of the user.
    - Returns:
        - `None`: This method does not return a value.

- `__str__(self) -> str`:
    Provides a string representation of the `User` instance.
    - Returns:
        - `str`: A formatted string that includes the user's ID, name, and email.

- `update_email(self, new_email: str) -> None`:
    Updates the email address of the user.
    - Parameters:
        - `new_email` (`str`): The new email address to be set for the user.
    - Returns:
        - `None`: This method does not return a value.

**Code Description**: The `User` class encapsulates user-related data and provides functionality to update a user's email address post-creation. Unique user IDs are generated using `uuid.uuid4()`, ensuring each user instance is uniquely identifiable.

**Note**: The `uuid.uuid4()` method is used to generate a random UUID for each user instance, guaranteeing uniqueness.

**Input Example**: 

```python
user1 = User("John Doe", "johndoe@example.com")
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to create a new `User` instance with the name "John Doe" and the email "johndoe@example.com".

**Output Example**:

```python
print(user1)
```
This will output: `User [ID: <unique_id>, Name: John Doe, Email: johndoe@example.com]`, where `<unique_id>` represents the UUID generated for this particular user instance.

These enhancements aim to maintain the original structure while providing additional clarity and detail where necessary.
