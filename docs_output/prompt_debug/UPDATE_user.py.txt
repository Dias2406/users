You are an AI documentation assistant. Your task is to update the existing documentation based on the provided changes in the code. 

Now you need to update the document for "user.py".

**Old Documentation**:
The documentation provided for the `User` class in `user.py` is comprehensive and well-structured, offering clear insights into the class's purpose, attributes, and methods. However, there are a few areas where the documentation can be enhanced to improve clarity and completeness. Below are the suggested improvements, implemented within the constraints of not altering the structure or the example values:

## Improved Documentation

### ClassDef User

The `User` class is designed to model a user within a system, uniquely identified by an ID, and characterized by a name and an email address.

**Attributes**:

- `id` (`UUID`): A unique identifier for the user, automatically generated upon instance creation using the `uuid` library. This ensures that each user has a distinct ID.
- `name` (`str`): The user's name. This attribute represents the full name of the user as a string.
- `email` (`str`): The user's email address. It stores the email contact information for the user.

**Methods**:

- `__init__(self, name: str, email: str) -> None`
    - Initializes a new instance of the `User` class.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `name` (`str`): The name of the user. It should be a valid string representing the user's full name.
        - `email` (`str`): The email address of the user. It should be a valid string representing the user's email address.
    - **Returns**:
        - `None`: This constructor method does not return any value. It simply initializes the `User` object with the provided name, email, and a unique ID.

- `__str__(self) -> str`
    - Provides a string representation of the `User` instance, including the unique ID, name, and email.
    - **Returns**:
        - `str`: A formatted string that includes the user's ID, name, and email address, making it easy to print and identify the user object.

- `update_email(self, new_email: str) -> None`
    - Updates the email address of the user.
    - **Parameters**:
        - `new_email` (`str`): The new email address to be set for the user. It should be a valid string representing the user's new email address.
    - **Returns**:
        - `None`: This method does not return any value. It updates the `email` attribute of the `User` instance.

**Code Description**: The `User` class encapsulates user-related data within a system, providing a structured way to manage user information. It leverages the `uuid` library to assign a unique identifier to each user, ensuring data integrity and uniqueness. The class also demonstrates basic object-oriented principles such as encapsulation and abstraction by managing user data and providing a method to update a user's email address.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the `name` and `email` parameters provided during the instantiation of a `User` object are strings. The ID is generated internally and is not intended to be modified directly.

**Input Example**: 

```
user1 = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to create a new instance of the `User` class with "John Doe" as the name and "john.doe@example.com" as the email address.

**Output Example**:

```
print(user1)
```
Executing the print function on a `User` instance will produce an output similar to: `User [ID: <unique_id>, Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com]`. Here, `<unique_id>` represents the automatically generated unique identifier for the user.

These enhancements aim to provide clearer explanations and ensure that the documentation is both informative and accessible to users of varying levels of technical expertise.

**Changes in the Functions**:
- Function user::User.__init__ has no changes.
- Function user::User.update_email has been added.

Please update the documentation accordingly, ensuring it accurately reflects the changes. Provide a comprehensive and clear description for any modified or new functions/classes.

**Note**: DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE OLD DOCUMENTATION THAT HAS NOT BEEN AFFECTED BY THE CODE CHANGES.
