Old documentation:
# user.py

## Overview:
The `user.py` file defines a `User` class that represents a user with a unique ID, name, and email address. It utilizes the `uuid` library to generate a unique identifier for each user instance. With the introduction of email validation via the `validate_email` function from the `.utils` module, the class now provides enhanced functionalities to initialize a user, represent the user as a string, and securely update the user's email address after validation. This file is essential for managing user information in applications requiring unique identification and basic user data management with an additional layer of email validation for integrity.

## ClassDef User

The `User` class encapsulates user-related data and operations. It is designed to represent a user with a unique identifier, a name, and an email address. The class uses the `uuid` library to ensure that each user instance has a unique ID. Furthermore, email validation is performed upon updating the email address, leveraging the `validate_email` function from the `.utils` module. This class is fundamental for applications that need to manage user information securely and efficiently.

**Attributes**:

- `id` (`UUID`): A unique identifier for the user, generated using `uuid.uuid4()`.
- `name` (`str`): The name of the user.
- `email` (`str`): The email address of the user.

### FunctionDef __init__

The constructor method for the `User` class. It initializes a new `User` instance with a unique ID, a name, and an email address.

**Parameters**:

- `name` (`str`): The name of the user.
- `email` (`str`): The email address of the user.

### FunctionDef __str__

This method returns a string representation of the `User` instance, including its ID, name, and email. It facilitates easy logging and debugging by providing a human-readable format of the user's information.

**Returns**:

- `str`: A string representation of the `User` instance.

### FunctionDef update_email

This method has been updated to include email validation before updating the email address of the `User` instance. It leverages the `validate_email` function from the `.utils` module to ensure the new email address conforms to the specified validation criteria. If the new email address is invalid, a `ValueError` is raised.

**Parameters**:

- `new_email` (`str`): The new email address to be assigned to the user.

**Raises**:

- `ValueError`: If the new email address fails validation checks.

## Called_functions:
The `User` class explicitly calls the `validate_email` function from the `.utils` module, in addition to its methods and the `uuid.uuid4()` function from the `uuid` library for generating unique identifiers. The inclusion of email validation through an external function expands the class's functionality, focusing on managing user information with an added layer of data integrity.

## Examples:

### __init__
**Input Example**: 
```
user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
```
**Output Example**: 
A `User` instance is created with a unique ID, name "John Doe", and email "john.doe@example.com".

### __str__
**Input Example**: 
```
print(user)
```
**Output Example**: 
```
"User [ID: <unique_id>, Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com]"
```
The `<unique_id>` part will be a unique UUID value.

### update_email
**Input Example**: 
```
user.update_email("new.email@example.com")
```
**Output Example**: 
- If `"new.email@example.com"` passes validation checks: The `email` attribute of the `user` instance is updated to "new.email@example.com".
- If the email is invalid: A `ValueError` is raised with the message "Invalid email address".

**Note**: The `User` class provides a straightforward way to manage user information with unique identifiers and now includes secure email updates through validation. This could be extended with additional functionalities, such as password management or role assignments, to enhance its utility in more complex applications.
