# user.py

## Source Code
```python
# user.py
import uuid

"""
Contains the User class which uses the uuid library to generate unique user IDs.
"""
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.id = uuid.uuid4()
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"User [ID: {self.id}, Name: {self.name}, Email: {self.email}]"

## Class Definition: User

The `User` class is designed to encapsulate user information, including a unique ID, name, and email address. It leverages the `uuid` library to ensure each user has a distinct identifier.

**Attributes**:

- `id` (`UUID`): Automatically generated unique identifier for the user.
- `name` (`str`): The user's name.
- `email` (`str`): The user's email address.

**Methods**:

- `__init__(self, name: str, email: str) -> None`:
    Initializes a new instance of the `User` class.
    - Parameters:
        - `name` (`str`): The name of the user.
        - `email` (`str`): The email address of the user.
    - Returns:
        - `None`: This method does not return a value.

- `__str__(self) -> str`:
    Provides a string representation of the `User` instance.
    - Returns:
        - `str`: A formatted string that includes the user's ID, name, and email.

- `update_email(self, new_email: str) -> None`:
    Updates the email address of the user.
    - Parameters:
        - `new_email` (`str`): The new email address for the user.
    - Returns:
        - `None`: This method does not return a value.

**Code Description**: The `User` class, defined in `user.py`, utilizes the `uuid` library to assign a unique identifier to each user instance at the time of creation. It includes methods for initializing a user with specific attributes (name and email), updating the user's email address, and generating a string representation of the user.

**Note**: The `update_email` method does not include email validation. It is recommended to validate the new email address before invoking this method to ensure it meets the required format.

**Input Example**: 

```python
new_user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to create a new `User` instance with the name "John Doe" and the email "john.doe@example.com".

**Output Example**:

```python
print(new_user)
```
This will output: `User [ID: <unique_id>, Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com]`, where `<unique_id>` represents the actual UUID generated for the user instance.
