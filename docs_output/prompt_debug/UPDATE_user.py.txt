Old documentation:
# user.py

## Overview:
The `user.py` file defines a single class, `User`, which represents a user with a unique ID, name, and email address. The purpose of this class is to encapsulate user-related data and provide methods for interacting with this data, such as updating the user's email address with validation. The class utilizes the `uuid` library to generate a unique identifier for each user instance, ensuring that each user has a distinct ID. This file is essential for applications that require user management and identification.

## ClassDef User

The `User` class is designed to represent a user within an application. It includes attributes for the user's ID, name, and email address. The class provides a constructor for initializing new instances with a name and email, a method for updating the user's email address with validation, and a method for obtaining a string representation of the user instance. The unique ID is generated using the `uuid.uuid4()` method, ensuring that each user instance has a unique identifier.

### `__init__(self, name, email)`

This method is the constructor for the `User` class. It initializes a new User instance with a unique ID, name, and email address. The unique ID serves as a fundamental attribute for the User class, providing a way to uniquely identify and differentiate each user instance within the system, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and supporting functionalities like user management and authentication.

**Parameters**:
- `name`: A string representing the user's name.
- `email`: A string representing the user's email address.

**Returns**:
- None.

**Note**: The unique ID is generated using the `uuid.uuid4()` method from the `uuid` library.

#### Examples:
**Input Example**: 
```
user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
```
**Output Example**:
```
A User instance with a unique ID, name "John Doe", and email "john.doe@example.com".
```

### `__str__(self)`

Provides a string representation of the User instance, including its ID, name, and email. This method is particularly useful for logging or debugging purposes, as it allows developers to easily identify and differentiate user instances among other data in logs or debug outputs.

**Parameters**:
- None.

**Returns**:
- A string that includes the user's ID, name, and email address.

**Note**: This method is useful for printing User instances in a readable format.

#### Examples:
**Input Example**: 
```
Assume a User instance with ID `12345`, name "John Doe", and email "john.doe@example.com".
```
**Output Example**:
```
"User [ID: 12345, Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com]"
```

### `update_email(self, new_email)`

Allows updating the email address of the User instance. This method now incorporates an email validation check. If the new email provided fails the validation, a `ValueError` is raised with the message "Invalid email address".

**Parameters**:
- `new_email`: A string representing the new email address to be assigned to the user.

**Returns**:
- None.

**Raises**:
- `ValueError`: If the new email address fails the validation check.

**Note**: This method now utilizes the `validate_email(new_email)` function to check the validity of the new email address before updating. The `email` attribute of the User instance is updated only if the new email passes the validation.

#### Examples:
**Input Example**: 
```
Before: User instance with email "john.doe@example.com".
Input: new_email parameter with value "invalidemail"
```
**Output Example**:
```
Raises ValueError with message "Invalid email address".
```

## Called_functions:
The `User` class now also relies on the `.utils` module, specifically the `validate_email` function, to perform validation checks on new email addresses during updates. This addition enhances the class's capability for maintaining data integrity and ensuring the validity of user email addresses.

## Error Handling and Exceptions:
The `User` class has been updated to explicitly handle errors or exceptions in the `update_email` method. This method now includes a check that raises a `ValueError` if the new email address does not pass the validation check. This enhancement aims to enforce data integrity and prevent the assignment of invalid email addresses to User instances.

## Thread Safety and Concurrency Considerations:
There are no additional changes to thread safety and concurrency considerations as part of these updates. However, the introduction of email validation in `update_email` means developers should remain mindful of potential race conditions, especially in scenarios where multiple threads might attempt to update a user's email concurrently.

## Future Enhancements and Limitations:
No new future enhancements or limitations discussions were prompted by the recent code changes. The existing recommendations for enhancing user management features and error handling remain relevant and important areas for development.

## Conclusion:
This documentation has been updated to reflect the incorporation of email validation in the `User` class, specifically within the `update_email` method. Through these updates, the class now includes improved data integrity measures by validating email addresses before assignment, ensuring the utility and reliability of the User class in managing user information.
