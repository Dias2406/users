Old documentation:
# user.py

## Overview:
The `user.py` file defines a single class, `User`, which represents a user with a unique ID, name, and email address. The purpose of this class is to encapsulate user-related data and provide methods for interacting with this data, such as updating the user's email address. The class utilizes the `uuid` library to generate a unique identifier for each user instance, ensuring that each user has a distinct ID. This file is essential for applications that require user management and identification. Additionally, it integrates with the `utils` module for email validation, enhancing data integrity by ensuring that email addresses are valid before updating.

## ClassDef User

The `User` class is designed to represent a user within an application. It includes attributes for the user's ID, name, and email address. The class provides a constructor for initializing new instances with a name and email, a method for updating the user's email address with validation, and a method for obtaining a string representation of the user instance. The unique ID is generated using the `uuid.uuid4()` method, ensuring that each user instance has a unique identifier.

### `__init__(self, name, email)`

This method is the constructor for the `User` class. It initializes a new User instance with a unique ID, name, and email address. The unique ID serves as a fundamental attribute for the User class, providing a way to uniquely identify and differentiate each user instance within the system, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and supporting functionalities like user management and authentication.

**Parameters**:
- `name`: A string representing the user's name.
- `email`: A string representing the user's email address.

**Returns**:
- None.

**Note**: The unique ID is generated using the `uuid.uuid4()` method from the `uuid` library.

#### Examples:
**Input Example**: 
```
user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
```
**Output Example**:
```
A User instance with a unique ID, name "John Doe", and email "john.doe@example.com".
```

### `__str__(self)`

Provides a string representation of the User instance, including its ID, name, and email. This method is particularly useful for logging or debugging purposes, as it allows developers to easily identify and differentiate user instances among other data in logs or debug outputs.

**Parameters**:
- None.

**Returns**:
- A string that includes the user's ID, name, and email address.

**Note**: This method is useful for printing User instances in a readable format.

#### Examples:
**Input Example**: 
```
Assume a User instance with ID `12345`, name "John Doe", and email "john.doe@example.com".
```
**Output Example**:
```
"User [ID: 12345, Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com]"
```

### `update_email(self, new_email)`

Allows updating the email address of the User instance with added validation. If the provided new email is deemed invalid by the `validate_email` function, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating an invalid email address. This enhancement ensures that email addresses are validated before being updated, promoting data integrity and reducing the likelihood of errors related to invalid email formats.

**Parameters**:
- `new_email`: A string representing the new email address to be assigned to the user.

**Returns**:
- None.

**Note**: This method employs the `validate_email` function to check the validity of the new email address. If the `validate_email` function returns `True`, indicating that the email is invalid, a `ValueError` is raised.

#### Examples:
**Input Example**: 
```
Before: User instance with email "john.doe@example.com".
Attempted input: "invalid_email_format"
```
**Output Example**:
```
Raises ValueError: "Invalid email address"
```

## Called_functions:
The `User` class now relies on the `validate_email` function from the `.utils` module for email address validation, in addition to the `uuid` library for generating unique identifiers. This change highlights an additional dependency and showcases the class's approach to enhancing data integrity through validation.

## Error Handling and Exceptions:
The implementation of email validation in the `update_email` method introduces explicit error handling through the use of a `ValueError` when an invalid email address is provided. This addition underscores the class's commitment to robust data handling and gives clear feedback to developers and users about incorrect email inputs.

## Thread Safety and Concurrency Considerations:
The introduction of email validation does not directly impact the thread safety or concurrency considerations previously noted. However, developers should remain cognizant of potential race conditions and ensure concurrency control mechanisms, especially when validation processes might be expanded in the future or involve external service calls.

## Future Enhancements and Limitations:
With the integration of email validation, the `User` class takes a step towards more comprehensive data validation and error handling. Future enhancements could explore extending validation to other user attributes, integrating with external validation services, or adding features like password management and user authentication. Scalability and performance considerations, particularly in relation to validation processes, remain important for future development.

## Conclusion:
The incorporation of email validation into the `User` class represents an important update aimed at enhancing data integrity and reliability within applications. This documentation update reflects the changes and improvements made, providing clear guidance on the new functionalities while maintaining the consistency and format of the original documentation.
