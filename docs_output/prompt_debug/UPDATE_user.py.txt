## Class Definition: User

The `User` class is designed to represent a user entity with a unique ID, name, and email address. It leverages the `uuid` library to ensure each user is assigned a distinct identifier. The class now integrates email validation during email updates by utilizing a newly imported `validate_email` function from the `utils` module.

**Attributes**:

- `id` (`UUID`): A unique identifier for the user, automatically generated upon instance creation.
- `name` (`str`): The user's name.
- `email` (`str`): The user's email address.

**Methods**:

- `__init__(self, name: str, email: str) -> None`:
    Initializes a new instance of the `User` class. The parameters and return value remain unchanged.
    
- `__str__(self) -> str`:
    Provides a string representation of the `User` instance. The functionality and return value remain unchanged.
    
- `update_email(self, new_email: str) -> None`:
    Updates the email address of the user, now including a validation check through the `validate_email` function before updating the user's email attribute.
    - Parameters:
        - `new_email` (`str`): The new email address to be set for the user.
    - Returns:
        - `None`: This method does not return a value.
    - Note: If the `new_email` does not pass validation, the user's email is not updated.

**Code Description**: The `User` class encapsulates user-related data, providing functionality to update a user's email address post-creation, now with added email validation. Unique user IDs are generated using `uuid.uuid4()`, ensuring each user instance is uniquely identifiable.

**Note on Email Validation**: The `validate_email` function imported from the `utils` module is used to verify the format of the new email address before updating the user's email attribute. This ensures that the email address adheres to a specified format and criteria set within `validate_email`.

**Input Example**: 

```python
user1 = User("John Doe", "johndoe@example.com")
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to create a new `User` instance with the name "John Doe" and the email "johndoe@example.com".

**Output Example**:

```python
print(user1)
```
Outputs: `User [ID: <unique_id>, Name: John Doe, Email: johndoe@example.com]`, where `<unique_id>` represents the UUID generated for this particular user instance.

**Additional Note**: The integration of `validate_email` requires that any updates to a user's email address must now pass the validation check to be successful, enhancing data integrity and consistency for user email addresses.

--- 

This documentation update accurately reflects the integration of the email validation functionality and the import of the `validate_email` function, along with maintaining the structure and details of the unaffected sections from the original documentation.

Please provide the updated documentation content. DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE OLD DOCUMENTATION THAT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED IN THE COMMENT.
