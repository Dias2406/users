# utils.py

## Overview:
The `utils.py` file contains utility functions that are designed to perform specific tasks which can be reused across different parts of a project. In this case, it includes a function named `validate_email` that is responsible for validating email addresses using regular expressions (regex). This function is crucial for ensuring data integrity and validation in applications that handle user information, particularly when dealing with email addresses.

## FunctionDef validate_email

The `validate_email` function is designed to validate email addresses by checking them against a predefined regex pattern. This function plays a critical role in verifying that the email addresses provided by users or collected by the system adhere to a standard format, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and preventing errors in applications that rely on valid email addresses for communication or identification purposes.

**Parameters**:
- `email` (str): The email address to be validated.

**Returns**:
- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email address matches the regex pattern, indicating it is valid. Returns `False` otherwise.

**Note**: The regex pattern used for validation (`r'^[a-z0-9]+[\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\w+[.]\w+$'`) is designed to match a wide range of email formats but may not cover all possible valid email addresses as defined by the RFC standards. It's important to consider this limitation when using this function in applications that require strict email validation.

### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 

```
validate_email("john.doe@example.com")
```
This input example demonstrates the use of the `validate_email` function with a typical email address format. The function is expected to validate this email address as it matches the regex pattern.

**Output Example**:

```
True
```
The output is `True`, indicating that the email address `"john.doe@example.com"` is valid according to the regex pattern used by the `validate_email` function.

**Input Examples**: 

```
validate_email("invalid-email")
```
This input example shows the function being used with an invalid email address that does not match the expected format.

**Output Example**:

```
False
```
The output is `False`, indicating that the input `"invalid-email"` does not conform to the regex pattern and is therefore considered invalid.

## Called_functions:
The `validate_email` function utilizes the `re.match` method from Python's built-in `re` module to perform regex matching against the provided email address. This method is crucial for the functionality of `validate_email`, as it allows the function to compare the email address against the specified regex pattern to determine its validity. There are no other custom functions called within `validate_email`, making it a standalone utility function within the `utils.py` file.
