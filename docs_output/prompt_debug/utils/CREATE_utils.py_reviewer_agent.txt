## Overview:
The `utils.py` file contains utility functions that are designed to perform specific tasks which can be reused across different parts of a project. In this case, the file includes a function `validate_email` that is used to validate email addresses using regular expressions. This function is crucial for ensuring that email addresses provided by users or collected from various sources meet a standard format before they are processed or stored. The use of regular expressions for validation allows for flexible yet precise matching of email patterns.

## FunctionDef validate_email

The `validate_email` function is designed to validate email addresses based on a predefined pattern using regular expressions. It ensures that the input string conforms to a standard email format, which is essential for operations requiring a valid email address, such as sending notifications or verifying user accounts.

**Parameters**:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated. It is expected to be a string that potentially represents an email address.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email address matches the predefined pattern, indicating it is valid. Returns `False` otherwise.

**Functionality**: The function utilizes the `re.match` method from the `re` (regular expressions) module to compare the input email against a specific pattern. The pattern allows for email addresses that start with alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a dot or underscore, then an `@` symbol, followed by more alphanumeric characters, a dot, and finally, alphanumeric characters to represent the domain.

**Important Implementation Details**: The regular expression pattern is defined as a raw string (`r'...'`) to simplify the syntax by avoiding the need for double backslashes as escape characters.

## Examples:

**Input Examples**: 

```
"john.doe@example.com"
```
This input is a string that represents a typical email address format, including the user name, the `@` symbol, and the domain part.

**Output Example**:

```
True
```
The output is `True` because the input email address `"john.doe@example.com"` matches the pattern defined in the `validate_email` function, indicating it is a valid email address.

**Input Examples**: 

```
"invalid-email"
```
This input is a string that does not conform to the standard email address format, lacking the `@` symbol and the domain part.

**Output Example**:

```
False
```
The output is `False` because the input string `"invalid-email"` does not match the pattern of a valid email address, indicating it is invalid.

## Called_functions:
The `validate_email` function relies on the `re.match` method from the Python standard library's `re` module for regular expression matching. This method is used to compare the input email address against a predefined pattern to determine its validity. There are no external callee functions from this file (`utils/utils.py`) mentioned, making `validate_email` a self-contained function.

**Note**: The use of regular expressions for email validation is a common practice, but it's important to ensure that the pattern used is comprehensive enough to cover most valid email formats while excluding invalid ones. Adjustments to the pattern may be necessary based on specific requirements or updates to email address standards.
