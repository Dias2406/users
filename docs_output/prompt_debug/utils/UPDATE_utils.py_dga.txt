Explanation of code context:
The Python file `utils.py` is located within a `utils` directory and contains utility functions that can be used across the application. Specifically, it defines a function named `validate_email` that validates email addresses using regular expressions. The function:
- Takes a single argument, `email`, which is the email address to be validated.
- Defines a regular expression pattern that matches valid email addresses. The pattern allows for alphanumeric characters before and after an optional dot (`.`) or underscore (`_`), followed by the `@` symbol, and then a domain name with at least one dot.
- Uses the `re.match` function from the `re` (regular expressions) module to check if the given email matches the pattern.
- Returns `True` if the email matches the pattern, indicating it is a valid email address, or `False` otherwise.
