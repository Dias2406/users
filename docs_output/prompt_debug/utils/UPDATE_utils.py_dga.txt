Explanation of code context:
The Python file `utils.py` is located within a `utils` directory and contains a utility function named `validate_email`. This function is designed to validate email addresses using regular expressions. The function works as follows:
- It defines a regular expression pattern that matches valid email addresses. This pattern requires that an email address starts with alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a dot or underscore, followed by more alphanumeric characters, an `@` symbol, a domain name (alphanumeric characters), a dot, and a domain extension (alphanumeric characters).
- The function takes a single argument, `email`, and checks if the email matches the defined pattern using the `re.match` method from the `re` (regular expressions) module.
- If the email matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
