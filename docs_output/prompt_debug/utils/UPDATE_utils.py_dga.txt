Explanation of code context:
This Python file, `utils.py`, is located within a `utils` directory and contains utility functions that can be used across the application. Specifically, it defines a function named `validate_email` that is designed to validate email addresses. The function uses the `re` module from Python's standard library to perform regular expression matching. The `validate_email` function:
- Takes a single argument, `email`, which is the email address to be validated.
- Defines a regular expression pattern that matches valid email addresses. This pattern checks for a sequence of alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a dot or underscore, followed by another sequence of alphanumeric characters, an at symbol (`@`), a domain name, and a top-level domain.
- Uses the `re.match` function to check if the provided email address matches the defined pattern.
- Returns `True` if the email address matches the pattern, indicating it is a valid email address, or `False` otherwise.

This utility function is essential for ensuring that email addresses collected or used within the application adhere to a standard format, enhancing data integrity and reliability.
