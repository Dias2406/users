"""
Contains a utility function validate_email that uses regular expressions to validate email addresses.
"""
def validate_email(email):
    pattern = r'^[a-z0-9]+[\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\w+[.]\w+$'
    if re.match(pattern, email):

```

Explanation of code context:
This Python file, `utils.py`, is a utility module that contains a function named `validate_email`. This function is designed to validate email addresses using regular expressions (regex). The function works as follows:
- It defines a regex pattern that matches valid email addresses. The pattern allows for alphanumeric characters at the beginning, optionally followed by a dot (`.`) or underscore (`_`), then more alphanumeric characters, followed by an `@` symbol, then more alphanumeric characters, a dot, and finally, more alphanumeric characters. This pattern is intended to match common email address formats.
- The function takes a single argument, `email`, which is the email address to be validated.
- It uses the `re.match` function from the `re` (regular expressions) module to check if the given email address matches the defined pattern.
- If the email address matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email address is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Callee function information:
There is no specific callee function information provided for this file. The file primarily defines the `validate_email` function, which uses the `re.match` method from Python's built-in `re` module to validate email addresses. This function is a standalone utility that can be imported and used by other modules or scripts to validate email addresses based on the defined regex pattern.
