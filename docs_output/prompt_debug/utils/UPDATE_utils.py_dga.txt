"""
Contains a utility function validate_email that uses regular expressions to validate email addresses.
"""
def validate_email(email):
    pattern = r'^[a-z0-9]+[\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\w+[.]\w+$'

Explanation of code context:
This Python file defines a utility function named `validate_email` that is used to validate email addresses. It uses the `re` module for regular expression matching to determine if a given email address conforms to a specified pattern. The pattern checks for a sequence that starts with alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a dot or underscore, then more alphanumeric characters, an "@" symbol, more alphanumeric characters, a dot, and finally, more alphanumeric characters. If the email address matches this pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email is valid. If the email address does not match the pattern, the function returns `False`, indicating that the email is invalid.
