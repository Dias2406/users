"""
def validate_email(email):
    pattern = r'^[a-z0-9]+[\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\w+[.]\w+$'
    if re.match(pattern, email):

    return False
```

Explanation of code context:
The Python file `utils.py` is located within a `utils` directory and contains utility functions that can be used across the application. Specifically, it defines a function named `validate_email` that validates email addresses. The function uses the `re` module for regular expression operations to match email addresses against a specified pattern. The pattern checks for a valid email format, which includes alphanumeric characters before and after an "@" symbol, with optional periods. If the email address matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Callee function information:
There is no callee function information provided, indicating that the file does not call external functions or methods that are not part of standard Python libraries or the function itself.
