Explanation of code context:
This Python file, `utils.py`, is located within a `utils` directory and contains utility functions that can be used across the application. Specifically, it defines a function named `validate_email` that validates email addresses. The function uses the `re` module for regular expression operations to check if the given email address matches a specific pattern. The pattern is designed to match common email address formats, ensuring that the email address contains characters allowed in the local part, an "@" symbol, and a domain part. If the email address matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating an invalid email address.
