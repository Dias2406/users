Contains a utility function validate_email that uses regular expressions to validate email addresses.

def validate_email(email):

Explanation of Every Class and Function:
- **Function validate_email(email)**: This function is designed to validate email addresses using regular expressions. It takes a single argument, `email`, which is the email address to be validated.
  - **Purpose**: The purpose of this function is to ensure that the input string conforms to a standard email format before proceeding with operations that require a valid email address.
  - **Functionality**: It uses the `re.match` method from the `re` (regular expressions) module to check if the input email matches a specific pattern. The pattern used here allows for email addresses that start with alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a dot or underscore, then an `@` symbol, followed by more alphanumeric characters, a dot, and finally, alphanumeric characters to represent the domain.
  - **Important Implementation Details**: The regular expression pattern is defined as a raw string (`r'...'`) to avoid the need for double backslashes as escape characters.

Input/Ouput Examples:
- **validate_email**:
  - Input: `"john.doe@example.com"`
  - Output: `True`
    - Explanation: The input email address matches the pattern, so the function returns `True`, indicating it is a valid email address.
  - Input: `"invalid-email"`
  - Output: `False`
    - Explanation: The input string does not match the pattern of a valid email address, so the function returns `False`.

Called functions information:
There are no external callee functions from this file (`utils/utils.py`) mentioned in the provided information. The `validate_email` function is self-contained, with its functionality relying solely on the `re.match` method from the Python standard library's `re` module for regular expression matching. This function does not interact with other parts of the code through callee functions within the same file path.
