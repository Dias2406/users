Contains a utility function validate_email that uses regular expressions to validate email addresses.

def validate_email(email):
    pattern = r'^[a-z0-9]+[\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\w+[.]\w+$'

Explanation of Every Class and Function:
- **validate_email function**: This function is designed to validate email addresses using a regular expression (regex). It takes a single argument, `email`, which is the email address to be validated.
  - **Purpose**: To ensure that the email addresses provided meet a specific format criteria, which is essential for data validation and integrity in applications that handle user information.
  - **Functionality**: It uses the `re.match` method from Python's `re` module to check if the provided email matches a regex pattern that represents a valid email format. The pattern checks for a sequence of alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a dot or underscore, then another sequence of alphanumeric characters, followed by an "@" symbol, a domain name, and a top-level domain.
  - **Important Implementation Details**: The regex pattern used is `r'^[a-z0-9]+[\._]?[a-z0-9]+[@]\w+[.]\w+$'`. This pattern is designed to match most common email formats but may not cover all valid email address cases as defined by the RFC standards.

Input/Output Examples:
- **validate_email**:
  - Input: `"john.doe@example.com"`
  - Output: `True` (The email address matches the pattern and is considered valid.)
  - Input: `"invalid-email"`
  - Output: `False` (The input does not match the pattern and is considered invalid.)

Called functions information:
There are no external callee functions from this file mentioned in the provided information. The `validate_email` function is a standalone utility function that relies on Python's built-in `re` module for regex matching. It does not call any other custom functions within the `utils.py` file or from other files. Its primary interaction is with the `re.match` method to perform the regex matching operation.
