## FunctionDef validate_email

The function of the function is to validate email addresses using regular expressions.

**Parameters**:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: `True` if the email address is valid, otherwise `False`.

**Code Description**: The `validate_email` function takes an email address as input and checks if it matches a predefined regular expression pattern that represents a valid email format. The pattern allows for alphanumeric characters before and after an '@' symbol, with optional periods or underscores before the '@' symbol, and requires at least one period in the domain part of the email address. If the email matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Note**: It is important to note that this function only checks the format of the email address and does not verify if the email address actually exists or is currently in use.

**Input Example**: 

```
validate_email("example@example.com")
```
This input example demonstrates how to use the `validate_email` function by passing a string that represents an email address. The function will then check if this email address is in a valid format according to the specified pattern.

**Output Example**: 

```
True
```
This output example shows that the email address "example@example.com" is considered valid according to the regular expression pattern used by the `validate_email` function, hence the function returns `True`.
