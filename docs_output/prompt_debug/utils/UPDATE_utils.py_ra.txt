## FunctionDef validate_email

The function of the function is to validate email addresses using regular expressions.

**Parameters**:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: `True` if the email address is valid according to the specified pattern, `False` otherwise.

**Code Description**: This function uses a regular expression pattern to validate email addresses. The pattern allows for alphanumeric characters at the beginning, optionally followed by a dot or underscore, then an `@` symbol, followed by more alphanumeric characters, a dot, and finally, the domain. The `re.match` function from the `re` module is used to check if the given email matches this pattern. If the email matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating the email is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Note**: It's important to note that this validation checks the format of the email address but does not verify if the email address actually exists or is currently in use.

**Input Example**: 

```
validate_email("example@example.com")
```
This input example demonstrates how to use the `validate_email` function by passing a string that represents an email address.

**Output Example**:

```
True
```
This output example shows that the email address "example@example.com" is considered valid according to the specified pattern, hence the function returns `True`.
