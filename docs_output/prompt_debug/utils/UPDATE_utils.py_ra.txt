## FunctionDef validate_email

The function of the function is to validate email addresses using regular expressions.

**Parameters**:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: `True` if the email address matches the pattern, otherwise `False`.

**Code Description**: The `validate_email` function uses a predefined regular expression pattern to check if the provided email address adheres to a standard email format. The pattern requires the email to start with alphanumeric characters, which can optionally be followed by a dot or underscore. This is followed by more alphanumeric characters, an `@` symbol, a domain name composed of alphanumeric characters, a dot, and finally, a domain extension composed of alphanumeric characters. The function uses the `re.match` method from the `re` module to compare the email against this pattern. If the email matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating the email is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Note**: It's important to note that this function may not cover all valid email formats as defined by the RFC standards. It's a basic validation and might not be suitable for all use cases.

**Input Example**: 

```
validate_email("example@domain.com")
```
This input example demonstrates a simple email address that consists of a username (`example`), an `@` symbol, and a domain (`domain.com`).

**Output Example**: 

```
True
```
This output example indicates that the email address `example@domain.com` matches the regular expression pattern and is considered valid according to the function's criteria.
