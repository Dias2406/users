## FunctionDef validate_email

The function of the function is to validate email addresses using regular expressions.

**Parameters**:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: `True` if the email address is valid according to the specified pattern, otherwise `False`.

**Code Description**: This function utilizes the `re` module to apply a regular expression pattern for validating email addresses. The pattern requires the email to start with alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a dot or underscore, then more alphanumeric characters, an "@" symbol, more alphanumeric characters, a dot, and finally, more alphanumeric characters. The function returns `True` if the email matches this pattern, indicating it is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Note**: It's important to note that this validation pattern might not cover all valid email address formats according to the RFC 5322 standard. It's a basic validation and might need adjustments for more comprehensive validation requirements.

**Input Example**: 

```
validate_email("example_email@domain.com")
```
This input example demonstrates a simple use case where an email address is passed to the `validate_email` function to check its validity.

**Output Example**: 

```
True
```
This output example shows that the email address "example_email@domain.com" is considered valid according to the specified pattern, hence the function returns `True`.
