## FunctionDef validate_email

The function of the function is to validate email addresses using regular expressions.

**Parameters**:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email is valid according to the regex pattern, otherwise returns `False`.

**Code Description**: The `validate_email` function is designed to check if a given email address conforms to a specific pattern that represents a valid email format. It uses a regular expression (regex) pattern to match the email address. The pattern allows for alphanumeric characters at the beginning, optionally followed by a dot (`.`) or underscore (`_`), then more alphanumeric characters, followed by an `@` symbol, then more alphanumeric characters, a dot, and finally, more alphanumeric characters. This pattern is intended to match common email address formats. The function utilizes the `re.match` method from Python's built-in `re` module to perform the matching operation. If the email address matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating that the email address is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

**Note**: This function is useful for validating email addresses in applications where ensuring the correctness of email format is crucial, such as in user registration forms.

**Input Example**: 

```
email = "example_user@example.com"
```
This input example represents a string that contains an email address to be validated.

**Output Example**: 

```
True
```
This output example indicates that the provided email address matches the regex pattern for valid email addresses and is therefore considered valid.
