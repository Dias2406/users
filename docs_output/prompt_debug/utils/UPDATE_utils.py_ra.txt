## FunctionDef validate_email

The function of the function is to validate email addresses using regular expressions.

**Parameters**:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email address is valid according to the specified pattern, otherwise returns `False`.

**Code Description**: The `validate_email` function is designed to check the validity of email addresses by matching them against a predefined regular expression pattern. The pattern requires the email to start with alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a dot (`.`) or underscore (`_`), then the `@` symbol, and finally a domain name that includes at least one dot. The function uses the `re.match` method from the `re` module to perform this validation. If the email matches the pattern, the function returns `True`, indicating the email is valid. If the email does not match the pattern, the function returns `False`, indicating the email is invalid.

**Note**: It's important to note that this validation method might not cover all valid email formats as defined by the RFC standards. It's a basic validation that checks for common patterns in email addresses.

**Input Example**: 

```
validate_email("example@domain.com")
```
This input example demonstrates how to use the `validate_email` function by passing a string representing an email address. The function will then validate this email address against the predefined pattern.

**Output Example**: 

```
True
```
This output example shows that the email address "example@domain.com" is considered valid according to the pattern used in the `validate_email` function, hence the function returns `True`.
