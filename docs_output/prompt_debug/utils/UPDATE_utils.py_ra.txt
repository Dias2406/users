## FunctionDef validate_email

The function of the function is to validate email addresses using regular expressions.

**Parameters**:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: `True` if the email address is valid according to the specified pattern, otherwise `False`.

**Code Description**: The `validate_email` function takes a single parameter, `email`, which is expected to be a string representing an email address. It defines a regular expression pattern that matches common email address formats. This pattern ensures that the email address has an allowed format, including the local part, an "@" symbol, and a domain part. The function uses the `re.match` method from the `re` module to check if the given email address matches this pattern. If a match is found, the function returns `True`, indicating the email address is valid. If no match is found, it returns `False`, indicating the email address is invalid.

**Note**: This function is designed to validate email addresses based on a specific pattern. It may not cover all valid email formats as defined by the RFC standards. It's recommended to adjust the pattern if a more comprehensive validation is required.

**Input Example**: 

```
validate_email("example@domain.com")
```
This input example demonstrates calling the `validate_email` function with a string that represents a typical email address format.

**Output Example**: 

```
True
```
This output example shows that the function returns `True`, indicating that the provided email address ("example@domain.com") is considered valid according to the specified pattern.
