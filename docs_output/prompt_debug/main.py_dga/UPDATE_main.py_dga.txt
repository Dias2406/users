Explanation of code context:
This Python file is the main script that demonstrates the creation of a `User` instance and the processing of data using the `DataProcessor` class. It imports the `User` class from the `user` module and the `DataProcessor` class from the `data_processor` module. In the `main` function, it creates a `User` instance with a name and email, prints the user information, then creates a `DataProcessor` instance to process a list of data items. The processed data is printed to show the result. The script is executed by calling the `main` function if the script is run as the main program.

Callee function information:
1. Function/Class `data_processor::DataProcessor.process_data`:
```python
def process_data(self, data):
    return [item.upper() for item in data]
```
This method in the `DataProcessor` class takes a list of data items as input and returns a new list with all items converted to uppercase.

2. Function/Class `user::User.__init__`:
```python
def __init__(self, name, email):
    self.id = uuid.uuid4()
    self.name = name
    self.email = email
```
This is the constructor method of the `User` class. It initializes a new `User` instance with a unique ID, name, and email address.
