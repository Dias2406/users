# main.py Documentation Review

## Overview
This updated documentation provides a comprehensive explanation of the `main.py` script, which showcases the creation of a `User` instance and the processing of a list of data items using the `DataProcessor` class. Furthermore, it introduces functionality for updating and checking a user's email. The script aptly demonstrates class instantiation, method invocation, and attribute updating in Python.

## Function: main

The `main` function serves as the entry point of the script, demonstrating interaction with custom classes by performing specific actions.

### Actions Performed:
1. **User Instance Creation**: Initializes a `User` instance with predefined name and email attributes.
2. **Data Processing**: Utilizes the `DataProcessor` class to process a predefined list of strings, converting each string to uppercase.
3. **Email Update and Check**: Updates the `User` instance's email with a new email address and checks if the email was updated correctly by returning the previous email.

### Parameters:
- The function does not accept any parameters.

### Returns:
- The function does not return any value.

### Called Functions:
- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: This method is responsible for creating a new `User` instance with the specified name and email.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: This method processes a list of data items by converting each item to uppercase.
- `User.update_email(new_email: str) -> str`: This method updates the user's email to the new email provided and returns the previous email.

### Code Description:
- A `User` instance named "John Doe" with the email "john.doe@example.com" is created and its representation is printed to the console.
- The user's email is updated to "dias@gcom", and the representation of the `User` instance is printed again to showcase the updated email.
- The previous email is checked by invoking `update_email` with the user's current email, which is printed to the console.
- A `DataProcessor` instance is created without any initial parameters.
- A list of strings `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` is defined and passed to the `process_data` method of the `DataProcessor` instance. The method processes the data by converting each string in the list to uppercase.
- The processed data list and the checked (previous) email are printed to the console, showcasing the result of the operations performed on the data and the user's email.

### Note:
For the script to operate as expected, the `user.py` and `data_processor.py` modules must be present in the same directory as `main.py`. This script offers a basic yet enhanced demonstration of utilizing class instances, method calls, and attribute updates in Python.

### Input Example:
No direct input is provided to the `main` function as it does not accept parameters. The data processed within the function is a predefined list of strings: `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`. The email update operation is demonstrated with a predefined email value.

### Output Example:
```
<User instance representation with original email>
<User instance representation with updated email>
Checked Email: john.doe@example.com
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
The `<User instance representation>` output depends on the implementation of the `__str__` or `__repr__` method in the `User` class, showcasing the user's details before and after the email update. The "Checked Email" output illustrates the previous email before it was updated, confirming the successful update operation. The processed data output represents the conversion of each item in the input list to uppercase.
