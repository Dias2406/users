# main.py

## FunctionDef main

The function's primary purpose is to instantiate a User object and to process a predefined list of data using the DataProcessor class.

**Parameters**:

None.

**Returns**:

None.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: This method initializes a new User instance, assigning it a unique ID, name, and email address.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: This method takes a list of data items as input and returns a new list with each item converted to uppercase.

**Code Description**: This function acts as the entry point for the script, executing a series of steps:
1. Instantiates a `User` object with a given name and email.
2. Outputs the `User` object to the console.
3. Instantiates a `DataProcessor` object.
4. Prepares a list of data items and passes it to the `DataProcessor` object for processing, which converts each item to uppercase.
5. Outputs the processed data to the console.

**Note**: Execution of this script requires the presence of `user.py` and `data_processor.py` in the same directory, which contain the definitions for the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes, respectively.

**Input Example**: 

```
There is no direct input to this function. It internally utilizes a list of strings as input for the DataProcessor.process_data function.
```

**Output Example**: 

```
The output includes a representation of the User instance printed to the console, followed by a list of the processed data in uppercase.
Example:
<User object at 0x7fcd3e4>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
