# main.py

## FunctionDef main

The function demonstrates the instantiation of a `User` object and the processing of data through the `DataProcessor` class.

**Code Description**: This function acts as the script's entry point. Initially, it instantiates the `User` class with predefined name and email attributes, then outputs the user's information. Subsequently, it instantiates the `DataProcessor` class and applies it to a predefined list of data items. The processed data, which is the original data items transformed to uppercase, is outputted to the console. This function illustrates the fundamental application of the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes by incorporating them into a straightforward workflow.

**Note**: This script is designed to function as the primary program. It exemplifies the instantiation and utilization of the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes. It is crucial to ensure that the `user` and `data_processor` modules are properly imported and accessible within the same environment as this script.

**Input Example**: 

```
No direct input is fed into the `main` function. It internally utilizes a list of strings: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"].
```

**Output Example**: 

```
<User object representation>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
The precise output is contingent on the implementation of the `__str__` or `__repr__` method within the `User` class. The processed data illustrates the conversion of the original list of strings to uppercase.

## Note
This script serves as a basic demonstration and may require adaptation or enhancement based on specific needs. For example, the list of data items for processing could be altered, or additional features could be integrated into the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes to augment the script's functionality.
