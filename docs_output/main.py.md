# main.py

## FunctionDef main

The function's purpose is to instantiate a User object and process a list of data using the DataProcessor class.

**Parameters**:

None.

**Returns**:

None. This function outputs the user information and processed data to the console instead of returning any value.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: Creates a new User object with specified name and email.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: Accepts a list of strings as input and returns a modified list where each string is converted to uppercase.

**Code Description**: At the start, the `main` function initializes a User object with a given name and email. It then prints this object, which implicitly calls the User class's `__str__` or `__repr__` method to display the user's details. Subsequently, a DataProcessor object is instantiated, and a predefined list of strings is processed through its `process_data` method. This method transforms each string in the list to uppercase. The function concludes by printing the processed list to the console.

**Note**: This script is a simple demonstration of using class instances and invoking their methods in Python. For the script to execute as intended, the `user` and `data_processor` modules must be properly implemented and present in the project directory.

**Input Example**: 

```
The `main` function does not accept direct input. Internally, it utilizes a list of strings ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] as input for the `process_data` method.
```

**Output Example**: 

```
<User instance information>
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
The output for the user instance will vary based on the `User` class's `__str__` or `__repr__` method implementation. The processed data output illustrates the conversion of the original list items to uppercase.
