# main.py

## FunctionDef main

The function's primary purpose is to instantiate a User object and utilize the DataProcessor class to manipulate data.

**Parameters**:

None.

**Returns**:

None.

**Called_functions**:

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: This method initializes a new User object with a specified name and email address.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: This method processes a given list of data items, transforming each item into uppercase.
- `DataProcessor.check_emails(emails: list) -> list`: This method evaluates the validity of each email address in a provided list, returning a list of boolean values corresponding to each email's validity.

**Code Description**: The `main` function acts as the script's entry point, orchestrating the following operations:
- It creates a `User` object with predefined name and email attributes.
- It initializes a `DataProcessor` instance for data manipulation tasks.
- Utilizing the `DataProcessor` instance, it processes a predefined list of data items (`["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`), converting them to uppercase.
- It evaluates the validity of a predefined list of email addresses, determining whether each is valid or not.
- Finally, it outputs the results of the data processing and email validity checks.

**Note**: This script serves as a demonstration of how to use the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes together. It is crucial to ensure that both the `user` and `data_processor` modules are properly imported and accessible within the same directory or Python path for the script to function correctly.

**Input Example**: 

```
The main function does not accept direct input as it is designed to be the script's entry point. Internally, it utilizes a list of data items and a list of email addresses for its processing tasks.
```

**Output Example**: 

```
Checked Emails: [True, False]
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```

This output demonstrates the outcomes of the data processing and email validity checks performed by the script. The processed data is shown as a list of the original items transformed into uppercase. The email validity check results are presented as a list of boolean values, where `True` indicates a valid email address and `False` signifies an invalid one.
