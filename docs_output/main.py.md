# main.py Documentation Review

## Overview
This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the `main.py` script, which is designed to demonstrate the creation of a `User` instance and the processing of a list of data items using the `DataProcessor` class. The script showcases basic object-oriented programming concepts in Python, including class instantiation and method invocation.

## Function: main

The `main` function acts as the entry point of the script, illustrating how to work with custom classes in Python by performing a series of operations that involve creating and utilizing instances of the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes.

### Parameters

The `main` function does not accept any parameters.

### Returns

The function does not return any value.

### Called Functions

- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: This method is called to initialize a new `User` instance with the specified `name` and `email`.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: Invoked to process a list of data items. The method converts each item in the list to uppercase and returns the modified list.

### Code Description

Upon execution, the `main` function performs the following operations in sequence:

1. **User Instance Creation**: Instantiates a `User` object with the name "John Doe" and the email "john.doe@example.com".
2. **User Instance Output**: Prints the string representation of the `User` instance to the console. The exact output format is dependent on the implementation of the `User` class's `__str__` or `__repr__` method.
3. **DataProcessor Instance Creation**: Creates an instance of the `DataProcessor` class.
4. **Data Processing**: Defines a list of strings `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` and passes it to the `process_data` method of the `DataProcessor` instance. This method processes the data by converting each string in the list to uppercase.
5. **Processed Data Output**: Prints the processed data list to the console, showcasing the conversion to uppercase.

### Note

For the script to run successfully, it is essential that the `user` and `data_processor` modules are correctly imported and available in the project directory. These modules contain the definitions for the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes, respectively.

### Input Example

The `main` function does not directly accept any external input. It internally utilizes a predefined list of strings: `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.

### Output Example

The script produces two primary outputs to the console:

1. The string representation of the `User` instance, which is implementation-dependent and thus not specified here.
2. The processed data list in uppercase: `['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']`.

This output demonstrates the successful creation and utilization of the `User` and `DataProcessor` instances to achieve the script's objectives.
