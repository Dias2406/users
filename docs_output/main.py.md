# main.py Documentation Review

## Source Code Overview
The `main.py` script is designed to demonstrate the instantiation of a `User` object and the utilization of the `DataProcessor` class to manipulate a list of data. The script is structured to perform a series of operations that include creating a user, processing a predefined list of strings, and outputting the results to the console.

## Function: main

The `main` function acts as the central execution point of the script, orchestrating the creation of a `User` instance and the processing of data through the `DataProcessor` class.

### Parameters
- The function does not accept any parameters.

### Returns
- The function does not return any values.

### Called Functions
- `User.__init__(name: str, email: str)`: This method is responsible for initializing a new `User` object with the provided `name` and `email` attributes.
- `DataProcessor.process_data(data: list) -> list`: This method takes a list of strings as input and returns a new list where each string is transformed to uppercase, demonstrating a simple data processing operation.

### Code Description
The `main` function sequentially executes the following steps:
1. Instantiates a `User` object with the name "John Doe" and the email "john.doe@example.com".
2. Outputs the `User` object to the console, which implicitly calls the object's `__str__` or `__repr__` method to generate a user-friendly representation.
3. Instantiates a `DataProcessor` object without requiring any initial parameters.
4. Prepares a list of strings `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` and passes it to the `process_data` method of the `DataProcessor` object. This method processes the data by converting each string to uppercase.
5. Outputs the processed data to the console, showcasing the result of the data processing operation.

### Note
For the script to function as intended, it is essential that the `User` and `DataProcessor` classes are defined in their respective files (`user.py` and `data_processor.py`) with the correct implementations. These classes play a crucial role in the script's operation by providing user management and data processing capabilities.

### Input Example
The function does not directly accept external input as it is designed to be executed as the main entry point of the script. Internally, it utilizes a predefined list of strings `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]` to demonstrate the data processing functionality.

### Output Example
Upon execution, the script produces output to the console in the following format:
```
User: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com
Processed Data: ['APPLE', 'BANANA', 'CHERRY']
```
This output comprises two parts: a textual representation of the `User` object and the list of processed data items, each converted to uppercase, illustrating the script's data processing capability.
