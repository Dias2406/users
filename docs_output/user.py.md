# user.py

## Overview:
The `user.py` file defines a `User` class that represents a user with a unique ID, name, and email address. It utilizes the `uuid` library to generate a unique identifier for each user instance. The class provides functionalities to initialize a user, represent the user as a string, and update the user's email address. This file is essential for managing user information in applications that require unique identification and basic user data management.

## ClassDef User

The `User` class encapsulates user-related data and operations. It is designed to represent a user with a unique identifier, a name, and an email address. The class uses the `uuid` library to ensure that each user instance has a unique ID. This class is fundamental for applications that need to manage user information securely and efficiently.

**Attributes**:

- `id` (`UUID`): A unique identifier for the user, generated using `uuid.uuid4()`.
- `name` (`str`): The name of the user.
- `email` (`str`): The email address of the user.

### FunctionDef __init__

The constructor method for the `User` class. It initializes a new `User` instance with a unique ID, a name, and an email address.

**Parameters**:

- `name` (`str`): The name of the user.
- `email` (`str`): The email address of the user.

### FunctionDef __str__

This method returns a string representation of the `User` instance, including its ID, name, and email. It facilitates easy logging and debugging by providing a human-readable format of the user's information.

**Returns**:

- `str`: A string representation of the `User` instance.

### FunctionDef update_email

This method allows updating the email address of the `User` instance. It is useful for maintaining up-to-date user information.

**Parameters**:

- `new_email` (`str`): The new email address to be assigned to the user.

## Called_functions:
The `User` class does not explicitly call external functions beyond its methods and the `uuid.uuid4()` function from the `uuid` library for generating unique identifiers. The class is designed to be self-contained, focusing on managing user information.

## Examples:

### __init__
**Input Example**: 
```
user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
```
**Output Example**: 
A `User` instance is created with a unique ID, name "John Doe", and email "john.doe@example.com".

### __str__
**Input Example**: 
```
print(user)
```
**Output Example**: 
```
"User [ID: <unique_id>, Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com]"
```
The `<unique_id>` part will be a unique UUID value.

### update_email
**Input Example**: 
```
user.update_email("new.email@example.com")
```
**Output Example**: 
The `email` attribute of the `user` instance is updated to "new.email@example.com".

**Note**: The `User` class provides a straightforward way to manage user information with unique identifiers. It could be extended with additional functionalities, such as password management or role assignments, to enhance its utility in more complex applications.
