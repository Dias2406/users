The documentation provided for the `User` class in `user.py` is comprehensive and well-structured, offering clear insights into the class's purpose, attributes, and methods. However, there are a few areas where the documentation can be slightly improved for clarity and completeness. Below are the enhancements made to the original documentation:

---

# user.py

## Source Code
```python
# user.py
import uuid

"""
Contains the User class which uses the uuid library to generate unique user IDs.
"""
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.id = uuid.uuid4()
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"User [ID: {self.id}, Name: {self.name}, Email: {self.email}]"
    
    def update_email(self, new_email):
        self.email = new_email
```

## Class Definition: User

The `User` class is designed to represent a user entity with a unique ID, name, and email address. It leverages the `uuid` library to ensure each user is assigned a distinct identifier.

**Attributes**:

- `id` (`UUID`): A unique identifier for the user, automatically generated upon instance creation.
- `name` (`str`): The user's name.
- `email` (`str`): The user's email address.

**Methods**:

- `__init__(self, name: str, email: str) -> None`:
    Initializes a new instance of the `User` class.
    - Parameters:
        - `name` (`str`): The name of the user.
        - `email` (`str`): The email address of the user.
    - Returns:
        - `None`: This method does not return a value.

- `__str__(self) -> str`:
    Provides a string representation of the `User` instance.
    - Returns:
        - `str`: A formatted string that includes the user's ID, name, and email.

- `update_email(self, new_email: str) -> None`:
    Updates the email address of the user.
    - Parameters:
        - `new_email` (`str`): The new email address to be set for the user.
    - Returns:
        - `None`: This method does not return a value.

**Code Description**: The `User` class encapsulates user-related data and provides functionality to update a user's email address post-creation. Unique user IDs are generated using `uuid.uuid4()`, ensuring each user instance is uniquely identifiable.

**Note**: The `uuid.uuid4()` method is used to generate a random UUID for each user instance, guaranteeing uniqueness.

**Input Example**: 

```python
user1 = User("John Doe", "johndoe@example.com")
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to create a new `User` instance with the name "John Doe" and the email "johndoe@example.com".

**Output Example**:

```python
print(user1)
```
This will output: `User [ID: <unique_id>, Name: John Doe, Email: johndoe@example.com]`, where `<unique_id>` represents the UUID generated for this particular user instance.
