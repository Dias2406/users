## Class Definition: User

The `User` class is designed to encapsulate user information within an application, assigning a unique ID to each user instance for identification purposes. It includes basic user details such as name and email address.

**Attributes**:

- `id` (`UUID`): Automatically generated unique identifier for the user, utilizing the `uuid` library.
- `name` (`str`): The user's name.
- `email` (`str`): The user's email address.

**Methods**:

- `__init__(self, name: str, email: str) -> None`:
    Initializes a new instance of the `User` class.
    - Parameters:
        - `name` (`str`): The name of the user.
        - `email` (`str`): The email address of the user.
    - Returns: None. This method does not return a value but initializes a `User` object.

- `__str__(self) -> str`:
    Provides a string representation of the `User` instance.
    - Returns:
        - `str`: A formatted string that includes the user's ID, name, and email.

- `update_email(self, new_email: str) -> None`:
    Updates the email address of the user, subject to validation of the new email address.
    - Parameters:
        - `new_email` (`str`): The new email address to be assigned to the user.
    - Returns: None. This method updates the `email` attribute of the `User` instance only if the new email address passes validation.
    - Note: The email validation utilizes the `validate_email` function imported from `.utils`. It is essential to ensure the new email adheres to standard email format conventions before updating.

**Code Description**: This class leverages the `uuid` library to ensure each user instance is assigned a unique identifier (`id`). It provides functionality to update a user's email address, subject to email validation, and to represent the user instance as a string, which includes the user's unique ID, name, and email address.

**Input Example**: 

```python
new_user = User("John Doe", "john.doe@example.com")
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to create a new `User` instance with the name "John Doe" and the email "john.doe@example.com".

**Output Example**:

```python
print(new_user)
```
This will produce an output similar to: `User [ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000, Name: John Doe, Email: john.doe@example.com]`. Note that the ID will be a unique UUID value generated for each user instance.

These documentation updates ensure that the descriptions accurately reflect the enhancements made to the `User` class, particularly regarding the conditional email updating mechanism which now incorporates email validation.
