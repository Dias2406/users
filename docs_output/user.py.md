## Class Definition: User

The `User` class is designed to represent a user entity with a unique ID, name, and email address. It leverages the `uuid` library to ensure each user is assigned a distinct identifier. The class now integrates email validation during email updates by utilizing a newly imported `validate_email` function from the `utils` module.

**Attributes**:

- `id` (`UUID`): A unique identifier for the user, automatically generated upon instance creation.
- `name` (`str`): The user's name.
- `email` (`str`): The user's email address.

**Methods**:

- `__init__(self, name: str, email: str) -> None`:
    Initializes a new instance of the `User` class. The parameters and return value remain unchanged.
    
- `__str__(self) -> str`:
    Provides a string representation of the `User` instance. The functionality and return value remain unchanged.
    
- `update_email(self, new_email: str) -> None`:
    Updates the email address of the user, now including a validation check through the `validate_email` function before updating the user's email attribute.
    - Parameters:
        - `new_email` (`str`): The new email address to be set for the user.
    - Returns:
        - `None`: This method does not return a value.
    - Note: If the `new_email` does not pass validation, the user's email is not updated.

**Code Description**: The `User` class encapsulates user-related data, providing functionality to update a user's email address post-creation, now with added email validation. Unique user IDs are generated using `uuid.uuid4()`, ensuring each user instance is uniquely identifiable.

**Note on Email Validation**: The `validate_email` function imported from the `utils` module is used to verify the format of the new email address before updating the user's email attribute. This ensures that the email address adheres to a specified format, and criteria set within `validate_email`.

**Input Example**: 

```python
user1 = User("John Doe", "johndoe@example.com")
```
This code snippet demonstrates how to create a new `User` instance with the name "John Doe" and the email "johndoe@example.com".

**Output Example**:

```python
print(user1)
```
Outputs: `User [ID: <unique_id>, Name: John Doe, Email: johndoe@example.com]`, where `<unique_id>` represents the UUID generated for this particular user instance.

**Additional Note**: The integration of `validate_email` requires that any updates to a user's email address must now pass the validation check to be successful, enhancing data integrity and consistency for user email addresses.
