The updated documentation reflects the modifications made to the `User` class within the `user.py` module. The key update pertains to the `update_email` method, which now incorporates email validation before updating a user's email address. This enhancement leverages the `validate_email` function, sourced from the `.utils` module, to ensure that the new email address adheres to appropriate standards.

# user.py

## Source Code

```python
# user.py
import uuid
from .utils import validate_email

"""
Contains the User class which uses the uuid library to generate unique user IDs.
"""
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email):
        self.id = uuid.uuid4()
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"User [ID: {self.id}, Name: {self.name}, Email: {self.email}]"
    
    def update_email(self, new_email):
        if validate_email(new_email):
            self.email = new_email
```

## Class Definition: User

The `User` class facilitates the management of user information, uniquely identifying each user with a UUID, alongside storing their name and email address. This class now incorporates a validation step within the email update process, ensuring that only valid email addresses are accepted.

**Attributes**:

- `id` (`UUID`): Uniquely generated identifier for each user instance.
- `name` (`str`): The user's name.
- `email` (`str`): The user's email address.

**Methods**:

- `__init__(self, name: str, email: str) -> None`:
    - Initializes a new `User` instance with specified name and email.
    
- `__str__(self) -> str`:
    - Returns a string representation of the `User` instance, including its ID, name, and email.

- `update_email(self, new_email: str) -> None`:
    - Attempts to update the user's email address, subject to validation.
    - Parameters:
        - `new_email` (`str`): The new email address intended for the user.
    - Behavior Change:
        - The method now validates the new email using the `validate_email` function before updating the user's email attribute. If the new email does not pass validation, the email will not be updated.

**Code Description**: Enhancements in the `User` class involve the prudent inclusion of email validation within the `update_email` method. This method leverages `validate_email` from the `.utils` module, ensuring robustness in maintaining valid user email addresses.

**Important Note**: The `update_email` method's ability to change a user's email is contingent on the successful validation of the new email address. It is crucial to provide a valid email format when invoking this method.

**Example Usage**:

```python
user = User("Jane Doe", "jane.doe@example.com")
valid_email = "jane.newemail@example.com"
invalid_email = "jane.newemail"

# Attempting to update to a valid email
user.update_email(valid_email)
print(user)

# Attempting to update to an invalid email (No change will occur)
user.update_email(invalid_email)
print(user)
```

In this example, the first attempt to update the email to a valid address will succeed, reflecting the change in the user's printed information. The second attempt with an invalid email will not impact the user's stored email address, demonstrating the validation process's effectiveness.
