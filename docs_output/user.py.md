The updated documentation incorporates the recent modifications to the `User` class, focusing particularly on the enhancement of the `update_email` method with email validation functionality. The updates reflect the integration of email validation through the `validate_email` function imported from the `.utils` module. These changes aim to provide a more robust and reliable user management system by ensuring that the email addresses associated with `User` instances comply with specified validation criteria.

# user.py

## Source Code Update

A notable change in the source code involves the augmentation of the `update_email` method within the `User` class. This method now incorporates a validation check for the new email address through the `validate_email` function, which is imported from the `.utils` module. This enhancement is pivotal in maintaining the integrity of the user's email address by ensuring it meets predefined validation standards before updating the user's email attribute.

## Modifications in Class Definition: User

### Updated Methods:

- `update_email(self, new_email: str) -> None`:
    This method has been enhanced with the addition of an email validation step. It now updates the user's email address only if the new email passes the validation check performed by the `validate_email` function.
    - Parameters:
        - `new_email` (`str`): The proposed new email address for the user.
    - Behavior:
        - If the `new_email` passes the validation check, the user's email address is updated to `new_email`.
        - If `new_email` fails the validation check, the user's email address remains unchanged.
    - Returns:
        - `None`: This method does not return a value.

### Notable Changes:

- The introduction of an email validation check within the `update_email` method enhances the reliability and accuracy of email address updates. By verifying the validity of `new_email` before assignment, the system safeguard against the inclusion of invalid email addresses, thereby enhancing data integrity.
- Dependence on the `.utils` module: The `User` class now relies on the `validate_email` function from the `.utils` module, emphasizing the modular design and the importance of reusable components within the system architecture.

## Updated Code Description:

With the new changes, the `User` class not only retains its original functionalities but also introduces a critical improvement in the form of email validation facilitated by the `validate_email` function. This validation mechanism is instrumental in ensuring that the email addresses associated with user instances adhere to specified validation standards, thereby enhancing the robustness of the user management system.

**Implementation Note**: It's crucial to ensure that the `validate_email` function in the `.utils` module is appropriately designed to meet the anticipated validation requirements. This function's design directly impacts the effectiveness of the `update_email` method's new validation feature.

**Input and Output Examples**: There are no modifications to the input and output examples as the user creation process remains unchanged. However, it's important to note that attempting to update a user's email with an invalid address (according to the `validate_email` function's criteria) will now result in the email address remaining unchanged, reflecting the enhanced validation logic.
