# utils.py Documentation Review

## Overview

The `utils.py` file contains utility functions designed to perform common tasks that can be reused across different parts of a project. Currently, it includes a function for validating email addresses using regular expressions.

## Function: `validate_email`

This function checks if a given email address conforms to a standard format using regular expressions.

### Parameters:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

### Returns:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email address matches the standard format, otherwise returns `False`.

### Code Description:

The `validate_email` function utilizes a regular expression pattern to validate email addresses. The pattern requires the email to start with alphanumeric characters, which can optionally be followed by a period (`.`) or underscore (`_`). This is followed by the mandatory `@` symbol, after which the domain name must appear with at least one period. The function uses the `re.match` method to check if the input email matches this pattern. If a match is found, the function returns `True`, indicating the email is in a valid format. If no match is found, it returns `False`, indicating an invalid format.

### Note:

It's important to understand that this function solely verifies the format of the email address. It does not check the existence or the active status of the email address.

### Input Example:

```python
validate_email("example@example.com")
```

In this example, the function is called with a string argument that represents an email address. The purpose is to check if this email address adheres to the expected format.

### Output Example:

```python
True
```

The output indicates that the email address `"example@example.com"` is considered valid based on the regular expression pattern defined in the `validate_email` function, resulting in a return value of `True`.
