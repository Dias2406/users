# utils.py Documentation Review

## Overview

The `utils.py` file contains utility functions designed to perform common tasks that can be reused across different parts of a project. Currently, it includes a function for validating email addresses using regular expressions.

## Function: `validate_email`

This function checks if the provided email address conforms to a specific pattern, indicating whether it is valid or not.

### Parameters:

- `email` (`str`): The email address that needs to be validated.

### Returns:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email address matches the validation pattern, indicating it is valid. Returns `False` otherwise.

### Code Description:

The `validate_email` function employs the `re` (regular expression) module to match the given email address against a predefined pattern. The pattern is designed to match email addresses that start with one or more alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a period (`.`) or underscore (`_`), then followed by more alphanumeric characters. After this, an `@` symbol is required, followed by more alphanumeric characters, a period, and finally, more alphanumeric characters. If the email address matches this pattern, the function returns `True`, signifying the email is valid. If it does not match, the function returns `False`, indicating the email is invalid.

### Note:

It is important to acknowledge that the validation pattern used in this function does not encompass all possible valid email formats as defined by the RFC 5322 standard. This pattern provides basic validation and may require modifications to meet more comprehensive validation needs.

### Input Example:

```python
validate_email("example_email@domain.com")
```

In this example, an email address is passed to the `validate_email` function to verify its validity.

### Output Example:

```python
True
```

The output indicates that the email address `"example_email@domain.com"` is considered valid according to the specified pattern, and thus, the function returns `True`.
