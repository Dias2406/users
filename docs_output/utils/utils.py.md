# utils.py

## Overview:
The `utils.py` file contains utility functions that are designed to perform specific tasks which can be reused across different parts of a project. In this case, the file includes a function `validate_email` that is used to validate email addresses using regular expressions. This function is crucial for ensuring that email addresses provided by users or collected from various sources are thoroughly verified against a standard format before they are processed or stored. The use of regular expressions for validation allows for flexible yet precise matching of email patterns.

## FunctionDef validate_email

The `validate_email` function is designed to validate email addresses based on a predefined pattern using regular expressions. Contrary to the traditional validation approach, this updated function determines that an input string does not conform to a standard email format, which is critical for operations where detecting invalid email addresses is required, such as filtering out invalid entries or handling user input errors.

**Parameters**:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated. It is expected to be a string that potentially represents an email address.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: Returns `False` if the email address matches the predefined pattern, indicating it is considered invalid according to the updated validation logic. Returns `True` otherwise, signaling that the email does not match the pattern and thereby treating it as invalid in conventional terms but valid in the context of this updated function's logic.

**Functionality**: The function utilizes the `re.match` method from the `re` (regular expressions) module to compare the input email against a specific pattern. The pattern aims to identify email addresses that start with alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a dot or underscore, then an `@` symbol, followed by more alphanumeric characters, a dot, and finally, alphanumeric characters to represent the domain. However, based on the updated logic, a match to this pattern will lead to the return of `False`, signifying the email is invalid.

**Important Implementation Details**: The regular expression pattern is defined as a raw string (`r'...'`) to simplify the syntax by avoiding the need for double backslashes as escape characters.

## Examples:

**Input Examples**: 

```
"john.doe@example.com"
```
This input is a string that represents a typical email address format, including the user name, the `@` symbol, and the domain part.

**Output Example**:

```
False
```
The output is `False` because, according to the updated logic of the `validate_email` function, the input email address `"john.doe@example.com"` matches the pattern defined but is treated as invalid due to the inverted return values.

**Input Examples**: 

```
"invalid-email"
```
This input is a string that does not conform to the standard email address format, lacking the `@` symbol and the domain part.

**Output Example**:

```
True
```
The output is `True`, indicating that according to the updated validation logic, the input string `"invalid-email"` does not match the pattern of a traditionally valid email address, thus being recognized as invalid which translates to a valid outcome in the context of the new function's purpose.

## Called_functions:
The `validate_email` function relies on the `re.match` method from the Python standard library's `re` module for regular expression matching. This method is utilized to compare the input email address against the defined pattern to determine its validity based on the updated logic. There are no external callee functions from this file (`utils/utils.py`) mentioned, making `validate_email` a self-contained function.

**Note**: The decision to invert the traditional validation logic stems from a specialized requirement to flag traditionally valid email patterns as invalid. It underscores the versatility in utilizing regular expressions for customized validation purposes and reflects a strategic approach to specific operational needs or error handling mechanisms.
