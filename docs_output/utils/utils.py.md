# utils.py Documentation Review

## Overview

This documentation provides details on the `validate_email` function contained within `utils.py`. The function utilizes regular expressions to validate email addresses, ensuring they conform to a standard format. This validation is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing invalid email addresses from being processed or stored.

## Function: `validate_email`

The primary purpose of the `validate_email` function is to validate email addresses against a predefined regular expression pattern. This ensures that the email addresses adhere to a commonly accepted format.

### Parameters:

- `email` (`str`): The email address that needs to be validated.

### Returns:

- `bool`: The function returns `True` if the provided email address matches the regular expression pattern, indicating it is a valid email address. It returns `False` if the email address does not match the pattern.

### Code Description:

The `validate_email` function employs the `re` module from Python's standard library to perform regular expression matching. The pattern used for validation starts with one or more alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a period (`.`) or underscore (`_`), and then another sequence of alphanumeric characters. This is followed by the at symbol (`@`), a domain name, and a top-level domain. This pattern is designed to match a wide range of email address formats used commonly across various platforms.

### Note:

It is important to acknowledge that the regular expression pattern used in this function may not encompass all possible valid email formats, especially with the emergence of new domain extensions and the use of non-Latin characters in email addresses. It is advisable to periodically review and update the pattern to ensure it remains effective in validating email addresses.

### Input Example:

```python
validate_email("example@test.com")
```

This example demonstrates calling the `validate_email` function with a string argument representing an email address. The function will then assess whether this email address is valid based on the specified regular expression pattern.

### Output Example:

```python
True
```

The output indicates that the email address "example@test.com" is valid according to the regular expression pattern utilized by the `validate_email` function.
