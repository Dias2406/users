# utils.py Documentation Review

## Overview

The `utils.py` file contains utility functions designed to perform common tasks that can be reused across different parts of a project. Currently, it includes a function for validating email addresses using regular expressions.

## Function: `validate_email`

The `validate_email` function is designed to check the validity of email addresses based on a predefined regular expression pattern. It aims to ensure that the input string conforms to a basic structure expected from email addresses.

### Parameters:

- `email` (`str`): The email address that needs to be validated.

### Returns:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email address matches the validation pattern, indicating it is valid. Returns `False` otherwise.

### Code Description:

The function employs a regular expression pattern to validate email addresses. The pattern dictates that a valid email must start with one or more alphanumeric characters, which can optionally be followed by either a dot (.) or an underscore (_). This is followed by more alphanumeric characters, an "@" symbol, more alphanumeric characters, a dot, and finally, more alphanumeric characters. The validation is performed using the `re.match` method from the `re` module, which checks if the input email string conforms to the specified pattern.

### Note:

It is important to note that this function validates email addresses based on a specific pattern and may not encompass all valid email formats as outlined by the RFC standards. For applications requiring more comprehensive email validation, consider adjusting the pattern or employing additional validation methods.

### Input Example:

```python
validate_email("example@domain.com")
```

This example demonstrates calling the `validate_email` function with a string that represents an email address.

### Output Example:

```python
True
```

The output indicates that the email address `"example@domain.com"` is valid according to the function's validation pattern, resulting in a return value of `True`.
