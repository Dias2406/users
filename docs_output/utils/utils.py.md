# utils.py Documentation Review

## Overview

The `utils.py` file contains utility functions designed to perform common tasks that can be reused across different parts of a project. Currently, it includes a function for validating email addresses using regular expressions.

## Function: `validate_email`

This function checks if a given email address is valid based on a predefined pattern using regular expressions.

### Parameters:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

### Returns:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email address matches the pattern, indicating it is valid. Returns `False` otherwise.

### Code Description:

The `validate_email` function employs a regular expression pattern to validate email addresses. The pattern is designed to match email addresses that begin with one or more alphanumeric characters. These characters can optionally be followed by either a dot (.) or an underscore (_). After this, more alphanumeric characters are expected, followed by the `@` symbol. The domain name must consist of alphanumeric characters, followed by a dot, and then a domain extension composed of alphanumeric characters. The function utilizes the `re.match` method from the `re` module to compare the provided email address against this pattern. If the email conforms to the pattern, the function returns `True`, signifying the email is valid. If the email does not match the pattern, the function returns `False`.

### Note:

It is important to acknowledge that this validation function does not encompass all possible valid email formats as outlined by the RFC standards. It provides basic validation and may not be suitable for all applications requiring email validation.

### Input Example:

```python
validate_email("example@domain.com")
```

This example demonstrates the validation of a straightforward email address comprising a username (`example`), an `@` symbol, and a domain (`domain.com`).

### Output Example:

```python
True
```

This output indicates that the email address `example@domain.com` successfully matches the regular expression pattern, thus being deemed valid by the function's criteria.
