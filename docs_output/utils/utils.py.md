## Function Definition: validate_email

The `validate_email` function is designed to validate email addresses using regular expressions.

**Parameters**:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email is valid according to the regex pattern, otherwise returns `False`.

**Code Description**: The `validate_email` function employs a regular expression (regex) pattern to determine if a given email address adheres to a standard format considered valid for email addresses. The regex pattern specifies that a valid email must start with one or more alphanumeric characters, optionally followed by a period (`.`) or underscore (`_`), and then more alphanumeric characters. This is followed by the `@` symbol, more alphanumeric characters, a period, and finally, more alphanumeric characters. The function uses the `re.match` method from the `re` module to compare the provided email address against this pattern. If the email address fits the pattern, the function returns `True`, signifying the email is valid. If not, it returns `False`.

**Note**: This function is particularly useful in scenarios where validating the format of email addresses is critical, such as during user registration processes on websites or applications.

**Input Example**: 

```
email = "example_user@example.com"
```
This example demonstrates a string input representing an email address that needs validation.

**Output Example**: 

```
True
```
This output signifies that the email address provided in the input example adheres to the regex pattern defined for valid email addresses, thus it is considered valid.
