# utils.py Documentation Review

## Overview

The `utils.py` file contains utility functions designed to perform common tasks that can be reused across different parts of a project. Currently, it includes a function for validating email addresses using regular expressions.

## Function: `validate_email`

This function checks if an email address is valid based on a predefined pattern using regular expressions.

### Parameters:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

### Returns:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email address matches the specified pattern, indicating it is valid. Returns `False` otherwise.

### Code Description:

The `validate_email` function employs a regular expression pattern to assess the validity of email addresses. The pattern is designed to match email addresses that start with alphanumeric characters, which may optionally be followed by a period (`.`) or underscore (`_`). This is then followed by the `@` symbol, more alphanumeric characters, a period, and finally, the domain part of the email. The function utilizes the `re.match` method from the `re` module to compare the input email against this pattern. If the input email conforms to the pattern, the function returns `True`, signifying the email is valid. If the email does not match the pattern, the function returns `False`, indicating the email is invalid.

### Note:

It is crucial to understand that this function only validates the format of the email address. It does not confirm whether the email address exists or is currently active.

### Input Example:

```python
validate_email("example@example.com")
```

This example demonstrates calling the `validate_email` function with a string that represents an email address.

### Output Example:

```python
True
```

In this example, the output indicates that the email address "example@example.com" is valid according to the specified pattern, and thus, the function returns `True`.
