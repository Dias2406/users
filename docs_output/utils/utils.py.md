# utils.py Documentation Review

## Overview

The `utils.py` file contains utility functions designed to perform common tasks that can be reused across different parts of a project. Currently, it includes a function for validating email addresses using regular expressions.

## Function: `validate_email`

This function checks if the provided email address string matches a predefined pattern that represents a common format for email addresses.

### Parameters:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

### Returns:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email address matches the specified pattern, indicating it is valid. Returns `False` if it does not match, indicating it is invalid.

### Code Description:

The `validate_email` function utilizes a regular expression (regex) pattern to validate email addresses. The pattern is designed to match email addresses that consist of the following components:

- A local part that begins with alphanumeric characters and may include dots or underscores.
- An "@" symbol.
- A domain part that includes alphanumeric characters followed by a dot and a domain suffix.

The function employs the `re.match` method from the Python `re` (regular expression) module to compare the input email address against the regex pattern. If the email address conforms to the pattern, the function returns `True`, signifying the email is valid. If the email address does not conform to the pattern, the function returns `False`, signifying the email is invalid.

### Note:

This validation function uses a specific regex pattern to check the format of email addresses. It is important to note that this pattern might not encompass all valid email formats as outlined by the RFC standards for email addresses. The pattern is designed for basic validation and might need adjustments to cater to more comprehensive validation requirements.

### Input Example:

```python
validate_email("example@domain.com")
```

In this example, the function is called with a string argument that represents a typical email address format.

### Output Example:

```python
True
```

The output indicates that the email address `"example@domain.com"` is valid according to the regex pattern used by the `validate_email` function.
