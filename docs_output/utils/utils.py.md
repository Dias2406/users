## Function Definition: validate_email

The `validate_email` function is designed to validate email addresses using regular expressions.

**Parameters**:

- `email` (`str`): The email address to be validated.

**Returns**:

- `bool`: Returns `True` if the email address matches the specified regular expression pattern, indicating it is valid. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating the email address is invalid.

**Code Description**: This function employs a regular expression pattern to validate email addresses. The pattern mandates that the email must start with alphanumeric characters, which can optionally be followed by a period (`.`) or underscore (`_`). This is then followed by the `@` symbol, and finally, a domain name that includes at least one period. The validation is performed using the `re.match` method from the `re` module. If the email address conforms to the pattern, the function returns `True`, signifying the email is valid. Conversely, if the email address does not conform to the pattern, the function returns `False`, signifying the email is invalid.

**Note**: This validation approach may not encompass all valid email formats as outlined by the RFC standards. It provides a basic level of validation, focusing on common email address patterns.

**Input Example**: 

```
validate_email("example@domain.com")
```
This example illustrates the usage of the `validate_email` function by passing a string that represents an email address. The function then assesses whether this email address adheres to the predefined pattern.

**Output Example**: 

```
True
```
In this example, the email address "example@domain.com" is deemed valid based on the pattern utilized in the `validate_email` function, resulting in a return value of `True`.
