# data_processor.py

## Overview:
The `data_processor.py` file contains the `DataProcessor` class, which is designed for processing data and validating email addresses. It leverages a utility function from another module (`utils.py`) to check the validity of email addresses. The class provides methods for converting strings in a list to uppercase and for validating a list of email addresses. This file is essential for tasks that involve data standardization and validation, particularly in applications where email communication or data processing is a critical component.

## ClassDef DataProcessor

The `DataProcessor` class is central to the `data_processor.py` file. It is designed with two primary functionalities in mind: processing textual data by converting it to uppercase and validating email addresses using an external utility function. This class is useful in scenarios where data needs to be standardized or validated before further processing or storage.

### Method process_data
The `process_data` method is responsible for converting each string in a given list to uppercase. This method is particularly useful for standardizing text data, ensuring consistency across datasets or inputs. Standardizing text to uppercase can help in scenarios where case-sensitive operations could lead to inconsistencies or errors, such as when comparing strings or sorting data.

**Parameters**:
- `data` (list of str): A list of strings that will be processed.

**Returns**:
- list of str: A new list containing the uppercase versions of the input strings.

**Note**: This method does not modify the original list but returns a new list with the processed data.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```
['hello', 'world']
```
This input represents a list of lowercase strings.

**Output Example**:
```
['HELLO', 'WORLD']
```
The output is a list of the input strings converted to uppercase, demonstrating the method's functionality in standardizing text data.

**Additional Example**:
**Input**:
```
['Hello', 'wOrLd!', '@test']
```
**Output**:
```
['HELLO', 'WORLD!', '@TEST']
```
This example demonstrates the method's ability to handle mixed case and special characters, ensuring all alphabetic characters are standardized to uppercase.

### Method check_emails
The `check_emails` method checks the validity of each email address in a given list by utilizing the `validate_email` function from the `utils.py` module. It returns a list of boolean values indicating the validity of each email address. A valid email address, as determined by the `validate_email` function, typically includes an "@" symbol and a domain name.

**Parameters**:
- `emails` (list of str): A list of email addresses to be validated.

**Returns**:
- list of bool: A list indicating the validity of each email address in the input list.

**Note**: This method relies on the `validate_email` function from an external module (`utils.py`), which should be correctly implemented for accurate validation.

#### Examples:
**Input Examples**: 
```
['user@example.com', 'invalid-email']
```
This input represents a list of email addresses to be validated.

**Output Example**:
```
[True, False]
```
The output is a list of boolean values indicating the validity of each email address, with `True` representing a valid email and `False` representing an invalid one.

**Additional Examples**:
- **Input**: `['name.surname@example.com', 'name+tag@example.co.uk', 'invalid@ email.com', 'justastring']`
- **Output**: `[True, True, False, False]`
This set of examples includes email addresses with unusual but valid formats, and common invalid formats, showcasing the method's ability to discern valid from invalid email addresses based on the presence of an "@" symbol, domain name, and absence of spaces.

## Called_functions:
- **utils::validate_email(email)**: This function is defined in `utils.py` and is responsible for validating email addresses. It uses a regular expression pattern to match email addresses and returns `True` if the email matches the pattern, otherwise `False`. The `check_emails` method in the `DataProcessor` class calls this function for each email in the input list to determine its validity. This function is crucial for maintaining data integrity and preventing invalid data entry.

## Potential Exceptions or Errors
Users might encounter exceptions or errors if the input parameters do not meet the expected data types. For example:
- If the `data` parameter for the `process_data` method is not a list of strings, the method may raise a `TypeError`.
- If the `emails` parameter for the `check_emails` method contains non-string elements, a `TypeError` may be thrown.

## Performance Considerations
When using these methods with very large datasets, users should be aware of potential performance implications. Processing a very large list of strings or validating a large list of email addresses might result in noticeable delays. It's recommended to test these methods with your dataset sizes to ensure acceptable performance.

## Customization and Extension
Users can extend or customize the `DataProcessor` class for their specific needs. For instance, modifying the `process_data` method to handle different text transformations or extending the `check_emails` method to use different validation criteria can tailor the class more closely to application requirements. This flexibility encourages users to adapt the class to fit their unique data processing and validation scenarios.
